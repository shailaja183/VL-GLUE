            "question": "Which of the following is both a transition metal and has no isotope older than the earth? This given figure shows the periodic table with the location of the chemical elements. They are sorted by atomic number. The noble gases make up a group of chemical elements with similar properties; under standard conditions, they are all odorless, colorless, monatomic gases with very low chemical reactivity. The elements in the alkali metals group have their outermost electron in an s-orbital: this shared electron configuration results in their having very similar characteristic properties. The alkaline earth metals form group II of the periodic table. The elements are all shiny, silvery-white, somewhat reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure.",
