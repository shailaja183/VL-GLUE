            "question": "who is running for president with person in the image The billionaire real estate mogul on Monday named New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, one of the Republican presidential challengers Trump defeated in his months-long campaign for the nomination, to serve as chairman of his transition team if he wins the election as the successor to President Barack Obama.\nChristie, like Trump an outspoken public figure, dropped out of the presidential race in February, after finishing sixth in the party primary in the northeastern state of New Hampshire that Trump won. Christie subsequently endorsed Trump's bid for the Republican nomination and has appeared numerous times at his campaign rallies.\nSome U.S. political analysts have mentioned the 53-year-old Christie, a one-time federal prosecutor, as a prominent possibility to join Trump on the Republican ticket as his vice presidential running mate, although Trump has not publicly mentioned whom he is considering.\n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Spokane, Washington, May 7, 2016.

But just days before the election, Clinton had failed to hold on to the respectable lead she once had in the polls.\nNational numbers released by ABC/Washington Post a week before the election put Clinton\u2019s lead nationally at just 1 point -- down from a 12-point lead the previous week. Other polls also showed a similar loss of advantage, bringing into question whether she will be able to shatter the glass ceiling she has aimed at for so long.\n Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks at a campaign rally at Pitt Community College in Winterville, North Carolina, Nov. 3, 2016.",
