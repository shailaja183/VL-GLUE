An ideal door would be one located in your laundry room or near your laundry facilities. Hanging your ironing board in this area of your home helps you stay organized by keeping your ironing board close to other laundry items. If you don’t have a laundry facility in your home, consider a place where you keep your laundry items, such as a closet that stores your detergent, laundry basket, etc. When hanging an ironing board over a door, the board can hang on either side. However, hanging the ironing board behind a door will present a more organized look as the board remains out of sight. While the over-the-door hanging method is one of the best ways to store your ironing board, there are many creative options out there.\\n1. Once you have purchased your hanger, follow the instructions carefully. Most products have a bracket system and easy installation requirements that do not require tools or assembly. Affix your hanger on a side of the door that will create less clutter according to your home needs. One downside to this hanging method is that the bracket of the hanger will be visible.\\n2. v4-460px-Hang-an-Ironing-Board-Step-4.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Hang-an-Ironing-Board-Step-6.jpg\\n4. There are many versions of this type of hanger and prices range from anywhere from $8 to $40. These types of hangers come in metal and plastic varieties. So choose according to your budget and taste. Many over the door ironing board hangers also include a space to store your iron. Keep an eye out for these products, and be mindful of the size and shape of your iron, too.\\n5. v4-460px-Hang-an-Ironing-Board-Step-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10000798, 'answer_choices': [[0, 5, 4, 2, 1, 3], [3, 2, 4, 0, 1, 5], [2, 4, 3, 5, 1, 0], [5, 4, 2, 1, 0, 3]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10000832.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. There are 45 different species of lavender with hundreds of varieties, so try narrowing your search by what you want lavender for. Lavenders in general are drought tolerant, but don’t handle the cold very well. If you live in a climate where the winters are very hard, you can still grow lavender plants, but you will probably have to treat them like annuals and replace them each year. Uses for lavender include landscaping, dried buds, culinary, crafts, fresh cuttings, and essential oils. There are different varieties that fit each of these uses differently.\\n1. v4-460px-Plant-Lavender-in-Pots-Step-2.jpg\\n2. Even it out along the bottom, but it doesn’t need to be perfect.

Simply stand near the talking student to get them to quiet down. Without interrupting your instruction, move near the talker, continuing to talk. You may even place your hand on their desk or on their shoulder to gain their attention. It also helps to move about the classroom as you talk, which is called mobility and proximity. This way, you will be near each student every few minutes.\\n2. v4-460px-Deal-with-Talkative-Students-Step-8.jpg\\n3. If a student repeatedly talks out of turn, speak to them privately about what’s going on. They may be dealing with personal issues that are disrupting their focus at school. Or, they may have an issue with the class or material. Ask them to share what the issue is and take steps to correct it if possible. For instance, the student may have a hard time remaining seated and quiet through a lecture. If so, try to build active lessons into the curriculum, such as breaking a lecture into 2 sessions, with a group project or time to reflect on the material in the middle.\\n4. Remind them of the classroom expectations that they agreed to. Depending on their age, you could remind them of a specific rule or your classroom quieting technique. What’s important is that you direct their attention to the positive behavior that you expect to see from them. For elementary students, you could remind them of your quiet down statement. Say, “Katie, we’re in ‘Hocus Pocus, Everyone Focus’ mode right now.”\\nFor middle or high school students, you could remind them of the classroom expectations. You could say, \"In this classroom, we respect others when they are speaking by listening.\" At the college or university level, you could remind the student why they are there. Say, \"I\\'m providing you the information you need to be successful, so it\\'s important that you listen.\" Keep your focus on the main issue at hand, such as your need for everyone’s attention so that you can teach.

Pull the student aside or stop by their desk to remind them that they’re in continued violation of the rules. Then ask them to tell you what the consequences are for breaking the rules. Tell them that this is their last warning before they receive the consequences. The consequences should be outlined in your classroom expectations, classroom management plan, or classroom contract, depending on which you used to explain the rules to the students at the beginning of the semester.\\n9. This is to get their attention so that you can address the talking.

If you are using a dress pattern, follow the guide to take your measurements with a soft tape measure. To create a dress using another dress as the pattern, fold it in half lengthwise. Place it over your fabric (also folded lengthwise) and trace around the outside. You can change the total length of your dress using either a pattern or your own measurements by measuring from your hips to the desired end point, and making this alteration to your fabric.\\n1. v4-460px-Make-a-Dress-Step-2-Version-4.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Make-a-Dress-Step-4-Version-4.jpg\\n3. Dresses are one of the more complicated projects to start with, and are easiest when made using a dress pattern. Patterns are the specific measurements and shapes the different parts of your dress will need to be cut in. These are available for free or for a small price online or in fabric/craft stores. Choose a pattern that is the style and shape you would like, in the correct size for your body type.\\n4. Any fabric can be used for a dress, although if it is your first time try working with an easy natural or cotton blend. Look for pretty fabrics that meet your color, pattern, and texture needs. Using silky or heavy fabrics are difficult to sew without a bit of practice. Additionally, choose a fabric that is thick enough that it won’t require two layers or a slip. You will need between 2–3 yards (1.8–2.7 m) of fabric total depending on your size and the length of the dress. Try using a large over sized t-shirt as the base for your dress. These can be found in thrift stores or even in the back of your own closet. Get creative with your fabric choice and try using a sheet or curtain as the fabric for your dress.

While tennis balls can be a great, affordable way to keep your dog active and engaged, be aware that they can also present a significant safety hazard. Not only can large dogs accidentally swallow or choke on the ball, but studies have found significant levels of lead in them, particularly in those balls labeled as dog toys and not intended specifically for sporting use. You can keep tennis balls in your dog’s life by taking some basic safety measures. Buy tennis balls in the sport section of the store rather than the pet section, and discard any ball as soon as it shows signs of tearing.\\n2. v4-460px-Avoid-Dangerous-Dog-Toys-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n3. You can avoid a lot of hazardous toys by checking the label for important information. The best toys to purchase are those identified and certified as safe for children under three years old, as this means the toy has been tested for toxicity and doesn’t contain any easily detachable parts which can be swallowed easily. It’s also a good idea to look for the national origin of the toy. Toys made in North America or Europe are more likely to meet general safety standards than those imported in bulk from China or Mexico.\\n4. v4-460px-Avoid-Dangerous-Dog-Toys-Step-8.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Avoid-Dangerous-Dog-Toys-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n6. Plush toys made for children often have small, hazardous parts like doll eyes, noses, and long threads or ribbons which your dog can choke on or ingest. Avoid potential health problems from these toys by shopping exclusively in pet stores and removing any hazardous features like tags, squeakers, or buttons. Plastic toys for children are also unsafe for dogs. Dogs have sharp teeth which can break and cause bleeding and damage to its teeth and gums, or a dog can swallow or suffocate on a broken plastic toy. Additionally, a harmful chemical compound called DINP has been found in soft plastic toys, so opt for natural latex or rubber over plastic if you’re in the market for a chew toy.\\n7. Dogs love rawhide bones, but you should seek expert advice before purchasing any for your dog. Imported and flavored varieties are bound to contain many more chemical additives and processing chemicals, and some bones are small enough to present a choking hazard to your dog. Avoid choosing the wrong rawhide by asking your vet which size and type of bone is appropriate for your dog, and see if they have any specific recommendations. Chewing on rawhide can also be a good way for your dog to clean its teeth naturally, so consider opting for a safe rawhide bone if you’re worried about your dog’s dental health.

List items that are high in demand, rare, or that would be a great deal because it is significantly lower than retail price. Include the price and use descriptive words so shoppers know why your coffee table is better than another one listed down the street. Furniture, appliances, baby items, power tools, and electronics are popular items that people that look for. If you are selling any types of these items, consider listing them as examples. Be sure to include descriptive words such as, “like new,” “one of a kind,” or “still in the box.” Don’t be afraid to use brand names if you know it is popular. Tell shoppers if you are firm on your pricing, or put OBO (or best offer) to indicate that you may accept offers lower than the listing price. Mention if your items come from a smoke and/or pet-free home. Ex: \"Fisher Price deluxe baby swing with 5 speeds. Like new—only used 2 times! Smoke-free home. $50 OBO\" or \"Gently-used Coach Purse.

A good name for your business can help you define your goals and motivate you to start your store. The name is also the first thing that your future customers will see, so it's important that your business makes a good first impression.

Crocheting a pillow cover is a simple project, but there are many different ways to go about it. You may find it helpful to use a pattern to create a specific design. Or, you can use a pattern as inspiration and follow it loosely to create your own unique throw pillow. Search online for free patterns or visit a local craft store to find pattern books. For example, you might want to follow a pattern to the letter if you are trying to create a specific shape or design in your pillow cover. Or, you may identify a pattern you like, but select different yarn colors to create it.\\n1. Crochet hooks come in many different sizes and you will get the best results if you pair your yarn with the recommended hook size. Check the yarn label or the pattern for a hook size recommendation.

Even if the employee is remote, you may be able to bring them in for training. This is usually the fastest and most effective training option for remote employees who live close to an office or branch. If they live far away, however, it may not be possible.\\n1. For companies that require collaboration or frequent communication between employees, instant messaging can be the most convenient option. This allows employees to talk and communicate in real-time. If your remote employee has any questions during training, they can reach out to you using the platform and get a quick response. Furthermore, instant messaging will allow you to send them quick feedback and messages regarding their work.

This document has different names in different states, but it essentially asks the court to validate the original will that you have found for the deceased person, and appoint an executor to administer that person's estate. Some states have more streamlined procedures if the deceased person had relatively few assets. In some states you must have the clerk acknowledge the will before you can proceed through the rest of the probate process. In other states, probate is opened at the same time the will is admitted.\\n3. All required petitions and forms must be submitted to the clerk of the court that will probate the estate. Typically this is the court in the county of the deceased person's primary residence. If you don't have an attorney, call the clerk's office before you go and find out how much you'll owe in fees to open probate, and what methods of payment are accepted. Fees to open probate vary widely among states. In some states, the total fee is a percentage of the total value of the estate. This fee isn't due until you start administering the estate and take a complete inventory of the estate's assets.\\n4. v4-460px-File-for-Emergency-Custody-Step-14.jpg\\n5. Your petition to admit the will may have already included a request to open probate. If not, you typically must complete a separate application that lists the name of the deceased person and provides information about the will and the estate. This part of the probate procedure varies among states. In some states, you must open probate first, while in others, you can open probate and request letters testamentary at the same time.\\n6. Many courts offer forms for non-attorneys to complete and handle probate on their own. However, the probate process is extremely complicated. Unless you already have some familiarity with probate, you probably need an attorney to help you. If the deceased person had an attorney draw up their will, you might want to start with them. Even though they may not be able to represent you in the probate proceedings, they can offer advice and recommend someone to work with you. Most probate attorneys provide a free initial consultation, so it's worth talking to someone even if you ultimately decide to go it alone. Keep in mind that if you're appointed executor, your legal bills will typically be paid by the estate. In some courts, if you elect to proceed through probate without an attorney, you're required to give the court notice and provide evidence of your competency to handle things on your own.\", 'question_id': 10004867, 'answer_choices': [[6, 0, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3], [1, 4, 0, 5, 2, 6, 3], [1, 5, 4, 6, 0, 3, 2], [0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 6]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/100049.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Decorate-for-Christmas-Step-6.jpg\\n1.

No matter what complicated emotions you might be feeling—sadness, anger, loneliness—do your best to open yourself to them, even when it feels hard. Notice each emotion as it comes, feeling it physically in your body and giving yourself the time and permission to experience it. This is primarily a form of self-kindness.

Clean your fixture with a soft cloth or paper towel and always remember to wipe in the same direction as the grain. Both white and cider vinegar can effectively clean your light fixture, but cider types leave a pleasant smell. Cleaning vinegar is best for light fixtures that have tough stains, as it is more acidic than other types. If you don’t have vinegar, one or two shots of olive oil (around the size of a dime) will work.\\n9. v4-460px-Update-Old-Light-Fixtures-Step-4.jpg\\n10.

Position the drill vertically over the pick, and press the 2 mm drill bit straight onto the pick. Place the drill bit about 2 mm down from the top of the pick. Slowly pull the drill trigger to begin drilling through the pick. Once the drill pops through the pick, the pick will wind up the drill treads. When the guitar pick winds up the treads, reverse the direction of the drill, so you can remove the pick from the drill bit. Use your fingers to wipe off any drilled plastic residue from the pick. If you don’t have a power drill, you can use a hand drill with a 2 mm bit to create the hole in the pick. Simply place the hand drill approximately 2 mm down from the top of the pick, and start twisting the drill with steady pressure. Once the drill is through, twist the hand drill in the opposite direction to remove the pick. If you use the hand drill, you can clean up the hole by drilling from the other side of the pick once you make that first hole.\\n3. v4-459px-Make-a-Guitar-Pick-Necklace-Step-4-Version-2.jpg', 'question_id': 100069, 'answer_choices': [[2, 1, 3, 0], [1, 3, 0, 2], [1, 0, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2, 0]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10007812.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Ignoring the behavior is the best way to show that it won’t get any attention from you. Don’t look at the attention seeker or ask them to stop. Just simply pretend as though they aren’t doing it. Many attention seekers enjoy negative as well as positive attention. For example, they might whistle because they know it will annoy you and you will snap at them. As hard as it might be, ignore the whistling in the future. Use ear plugs or listen to music while it happens. If the person uses stories to get your attention, make an excuse not to listen to them.

Depending on your preferences, the character’s name could be very important or secondary. If you like putting a lot of symbolism in names, then spend some time thinking about what you’d like this character’s name to stand for. Otherwise, focus more on the character description and pick a name that comes to you. Unless there is symbolic meaning for the character’s name, don’t stress too much about coming up with a great name. Focus more on description so your readers connect with the character. If you don’t care much about the character’s name, there are random name generator tools online that will help. One thing that is very important is keeping different character names distinct from each other. For example, having a John, Jack, and Joe will get confusing for readers. John, Armando, and Scott are much more distinctive names. Think about any nicknames the character has as well, and in what situations characters use different names. For example, if everyone calls a character Joe but during an argument his wife calls him Joseph, that could automatically tell the audience that she’s angry with him.\\n1. Many writers start off with a very short description of a character before doing a full profile. This quick description usually describes a distinguishing feature and sets the tone for the character’s role in the story. Before planning a character completely, imagine how you might introduce that character into the story and what you'd want the audience to know about them. Write this out in a short sentence to get started. When you get the introduction down, use all of the details you provided to build more background and personality for the character. You might introduce a character as “tired and looking much older than he really is.” This is a great starting point because it gives you plenty to dive into for the character’s background. Think about why they look older than they really are and what struggles have they faced that wore them down.\\n2. Physical descriptions are important for main characters. You may have already had an appearance in mind for your character before you started writing the profile, or you may have to develop one. In either case, write down your plan for the character’s appearance and how you’ll describe it in the story. Think about what the character’s appearance means for their personality as you move further. Start with very basic information like hair and eye color and clothes the character normally wears. Does the character have a beard or not? Is their hair color natural or dyed? Then get more detailed about the appearance. Decide if the character usually well-groomed or slightly unkempt. Think about what a well-groomed person could be hiding, or what a messy person might be struggling with. Also determine if the character has any distinguishing marks or features. A scar on someone’s face, for example, can tell a whole story about a character and how they received that injury.\\n3. v4-460px-Create-a-Detailed-Character-Profile-Step-2.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Create-a-Detailed-Character-Profile-Step-4.jpg\", 'question_id': 1000914, 'answer_choices': [[1, 3, 2, 4, 0], [2, 1, 4, 3, 0], [4, 1, 3, 2, 0], [1, 3, 0, 4, 2]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10009240.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Stop-Eating-Junk-Food-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\\n1.

In addition to teaching your loved one to develop a positive mindset, suggest that they help others whenever possible. Helping loved ones and doing charitable work are concrete ways of chipping away at low self-esteem.

They could also volunteer for their favorite cause, such as for animal shelter, soup kitchen, or youth mentorship program.

Tell the person you’re helping that there are external and internal sources of self-esteem. External sources are based on the opinions of other people, and they’re more superficial than internal sources. Tell them, “Your self-worth should come from within, not from other people. Instead of wanting to get good grades so other people think you’re smart, study hard to reach your personal goals or because you value knowledge.”\\nSay, “It’s fine to feel good when someone compliments you, but don’t let other people’s opinions define you. Suppose someone makes fun of you for taking piano lessons. You enjoy playing piano and you value music, so their approval shouldn’t make a difference.”\\n3. Some people think that self-love is selfish, and that feeling good about yourself is arrogant. If the person you’re helping is guilty about self-love, emphasize that there's nothing wrong with having a positive self-image. Explain that healthy self-love involves recognizing their strengths, accepting their weaknesses, being proud of their achievements. Distinguish healthy self-love from boasting about accomplishments to make others feel bad, which is probably a sign of low self-esteem. Mention that taking care of themselves is part of self-love. For example, taking time off from work to avoid burnout isn’t selfish. It’s a necessary part of maintaining physical and mental health. Remind them that self-love is not the same as selfishness.

Your IEP is created at the district level. Therefore, if your child transfers to a different school in the same district, your child's IEP won't change. However, adjustments may still be necessary depending on the resources available at the school. Many specialists work district-wide, so your child may be working with some of the same people. However, their schedule may be different since they are at a different school. While the IEP itself won't change, some of the details may have to be altered to fit the new school. For example, they may have special classes on a different day than they did before. Talk to your child about these changes and make sure they understand.

You still need to request the transfer as early as possible, to make sure the records are there before the child's first day. Provide both schools with the date your child will start at the new school. If at all possible, transfer between terms so your child has time to acclimate and perhaps tour the new school before starting.

If you are having trouble understanding the principles of feng shui, or your particular home is not cooperating with your endeavors, consider hiring a professional who can give you advice on how to apply feng shui to your specific living space.\\n2. v4-460px-Apply-Feng-Shui-to-a-Room-Step-4.jpg\\n3. The five elements of life are fire, water, earth, wood, and metal. Good feng shui in any room or home means having a mix of these elements. Most rooms will have a few of these already, depending on the structure of the room and furniture present. Look  around your room and see what elements are already present and consider ways to add the remaining. Candles are the easiest way to add fire to any room. Faucets already bring running water, but in rooms without faucets, consider buying a small fountain which can constantly be running water. Plants are a great way to add earth to a room. If you can’t easily incorporate something physically made of the element, hanging a picture that represents the element is a good alternative.\\n4. v4-460px-Apply-Feng-Shui-to-a-Room-Step-6.jpg\\n5. This map is a guide for what parts of the room are best for certain objects. It’s very important that you do your best to include something for every section because feng shui is all about creating balance. So if you load one section of the room, maybe the wealth section with ledgers and your piggy bank, but you neglect another section, you will upset the balance of the room. Maybe you don’t have a specific object, or enough space, to place something in every section. Something you can do instead is write down on a piece of paper something you care about which represents that or something you desire that represents that section. This can be a stand-in for the actual object. It’s also important to note that sometimes due to room or house layouts, parts of the map may be missing or partial. You can symbolically apply the feng shui to the wall where the missing section would be. Just make your intent for the missing section clear when you place something there.\\n6. This map is divided into 9 squares, each one representing an important aspect of balanced life. You can use this map in each room of your home to help you know what to place where. Specific spots in the room and specific objects have best possible energies, and the map helps you determine those spots. There is simple version of the map with just the names of the sections, and a more complicated version which gives examples of what all is represented by that section. Align the bottom portion of the map with the door/entryway to the room. Arrange the things that apply to each section on the map in the proper place in your room. In the lower left, place books which represent wisdom. In the middle right, which is “child” and represents creativity, place a musical instrument you play or a place where you can paint.', 'question_id': 100116, 'answer_choices': [[3, 5, 6, 2, 1, 4, 0], [0, 5, 3, 1, 2, 6, 4], [0, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 6], [6, 0, 5, 2, 3, 4, 1]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10011864.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Transfer-Pet-Ownership-Step-6.jpg\\n1. Once you and the new owner sign the agreement, it will be a legally binding document. Like any legal contract, your agreement should include standard provisions stating that the document represents the entire agreement between you and the new owner. If both you and the new owner live in the same state, you can simply provide that the agreement will be governed by the laws of the state in which you both live. If you live in different states, discuss the issue with the new owner. You also want to state where and how the agreement can be enforced. You can elect to go to court to enforce the agreement if necessary, or you can provide for mediation or arbitration. While it's unlikely you'll have to do this, the point of a written contract is to make sure all bases are covered.\\n2. As much as your pet is your friend and companion, they are treated as property under the law. You don't need to make any special agreements with the new owner regarding care and treatment, but you can if you want. For example, you may want your pet to continue going to the same vet. If the new owner lives in the same town as you, they may agree to do this. If your pet is currently taking any medications, discuss this continued treatment with the new owner. Make sure they understand the dosing schedule.\\n3.

You may want to reassign the employee you believe is embezzling funds to limit the extent of the theft. Typically, you only want to do this if it can be done without the employee suspecting they've gotten caught. This can also confirm your suspicions. If you take away the employee's access to funds and the embezzlement stops, that provides circumstantial evidence that they were the person responsible. For example, if you suspect your office assistant of taking money from petty cash, you might allow them to work from home for a few days. While they're at home, monitor the petty cash situation and see if money continues to disappear.\\n1. v4-460px-Report-Embezzlement-Step-6.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Report-Embezzlement-Step-2.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Report-Embezzlement-Step-4.jpg\\n4. Reporting embezzlement to the IRS is required for both nonprofit organizations and for-profit corporations. The amount of money embezzled is considered taxable income of the employee. Avoid reporting the embezzled amounts on a W-2 or a 1099-MISC, as these forms are for reporting income you voluntarily paid to an employee who earned that income. Instead, use Form 3949A. Download a copy of the form at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f3949a.pdf. Report the embezzled funds as a loss on your company's own tax returns. If you have a tax preparer do your company's returns, be sure to notify them of the embezzlement. Keep your audit report as proof of the loss.\\n5. If you have an insurance policy that covers losses due to employee theft or embezzlement, call your insurance company as soon as you discover the theft, even if you don't have any suspects in mind. Your insurance company may require specific documentation of the steps you take to gather evidence and identify the person responsible. Your policy typically requires you to file a notice of claim within a specific period of time after you discover the loss. If you wait too long, you may lose the ability to file a claim. After you complete your internal investigation, you'll typically file a proof of claim document that sets forth the amount of the loss and the employee or employee you believe is responsible. You may also have to include documentation of the disciplinary action that was taken against the employee.\\n6. Once you've gathered basic information about the embezzlement and the person you suspect of doing it, let other owners or board members know about the embezzlement so you can take action collectively. If the person you suspect of embezzling funds is an officer or member of the board, you may have to be more careful. You can't be sure there aren't others who are in on the scheme. Maintain strict confidentiality throughout this stage of investigation, particularly if you have narrowed down your suspicions to specific employees. Publicly identifying an innocent employer as an embezzler could open you up to liability for defamation.\", 'question_id': 10012401, 'answer_choices': [[0, 3, 2, 6, 1, 4, 5], [3, 1, 4, 5, 0, 6, 2], [1, 6, 0, 2, 5, 4, 3], [5, 2, 6, 3, 0, 1, 4]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10012730.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Fix-a-Bicep-Tear-Step-2.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Fix-a-Bicep-Tear-Step-4.jpg\\n2. Minor muscle injuries can often be treated at home, but serious injuries require prompt medical care. Signs that you need to see a doctor include a loud snap or pop when you suffered the injury, the inability to move your arm, and severe pain. Additionally, see a doctor if you notice a bulge, deformity, or dent at the top of your biceps muscle close to the shoulder. A bulge is a sign that one of the tendons that anchor the muscle is completely torn. Make note of any weakness, bruising, or inability to use the affected limb. The biceps muscle is connected to the shoulder and elbow, and complete tears can occur at either of these connections. Shoulder injuries are more common than elbow injuries. For elbow injuries, err on the side of caution and see your doctor. If an elbow injury requires surgery, waiting longer than 2 to 3 weeks can lead to complications.\\n3. Following the injury, keep your arm as still as possible, avoid strenuous activities, and do not lift your arm above your head. It might be helpful to get a sling at your local pharmacy or from your doctor to keep your arm still. For a minor strain or sprain, pain might start to subside within 7 to 10 days. A partial or complete tear may take 3 or more months to heal.\\n4. Since ice controls inflammation and can numb pain, it’s the best option for the first 2 days. After that time, use heat to improve blood flow and promote healing. Hold a warm compress to the affected area for around 15 minutes 3 to 4 times per day for as long as you experience pain.

The methods included here are fairly standard and should generally work with most washers.

If you only used cold water for your last load, go ahead and skip this step. If, however, you used hot water, give it time to cool off before you attempt draining. Don’t make things worse by scalding yourself. This is especially important with front-loading machines. With these, you can’t open the door and test the water, and your hands will definitely get wet once you start draining. The time it takes for the water to cool off to a safe temperature will vary by your settings and your machine. As a precaution, wear safety gloves when you start your project.\\n4. Again, this project shouldn’t create a huge mess, but be prepared for at least a little water to possibly go wild. Before you begin, set yourself up with some towels to keep on hand. Make clean-up a cinch by having them within easy reach in case you spill any water on the floor or elsewhere. Draining a front-loading machine is more likely to be messy than a top-loading machine, so if that’s what you have, expect more spills.

For instance, you probably sign your name without thinking, but what if you try to sign it backwards? Or upside down? Or backwards and upside down? Practice challenging your creative mind until you can master all three. Or, try engaging both sides of your brain by writing a simple question to yourself (e.g., “What are you thinking about?”) with your right hand (which is controlled by the left side of your brain). Then, immediately switch the pen to your left hand (controlled by the right side of your brain) and write the first answer that comes to you (e.g., “Eating an ice cream cone on a park bench”).

Though it’s best to let your hair air dry, if you’re in a rush you can blow dry it with low heat. Use the diffuser attachment so it works into your hair and dries it more thoroughly. The diffuser attachment will help set and define your curls, as well as control frizziness. Using heat on your curls will dry your hair out, especially if you have used mousse or alcohol-based products. Fight the dryness of your hair with conditioner.\\n3. Pick a moisturizing, sulfate-free shampoo so it adds moisture to your hair. The natural oils in your hair keep your curls shiny and weighed down. Shampooing too often can dry your hair out and make your curls more frizzy. Shampoos that contain sulfates are too drying for curly hair. They can leave your curls looking dull and frizzy. Avoid using clarifying shampoos since they remove the most moisture from your hair. On days where you don’t shampoo, only rinse your hair with water when you bathe.\\n4. Pick a wide-toothed comb to work your curls without damaging them. Fine-toothed combs will catch snags in your hair as well as make your curls frizzy. Fine-toothed combs can also rip out your hair follicles and make you lose your hair faster.

For instance, you should use the restroom before getting sent into the room. The only way you can leave a room is if you call for a staff to come get you, and then you usually cannot go back in. Also, do not try to take pictures or video during the game; this is usually explicitly against the rules and can get your team disqualified. Listen carefully to your guide about game rules and what can get you disqualified. For people who are uncomfortable about being physically trapped in a room, the reality is that you aren’t. The doors do not actually physically lock you in, and you can leave at any time. However, to avoid getting your team disqualified, you have to call for a staff to escort you out instead of just walking out of your room.\\n2. v4-460px-Win-Escape-Rooms-Step-2.jpg\\n3.

If you are experiencing difficulties expressing your negative or positive emotions, you are not alone. Give yourself a goal of making a single statement focusing on your emotional state each day.

It's not necessary to go around telling everyone that you love them. However, saying, “I love you,” to someone close to you is a good goal to have. Verbalizing your emotions is also important because it can help you to avoid withdrawing from relationships or activities, which is a common problem for people with PTSD\\n1. Many people with PTSD experience vivid flashbacks, essentially taking them back to a disturbing event or moment. If you've had a flashback and are concerned about another one, talk with your doctor about what actions to take. If you are around people, you might plan to ask for help. If you are alone, sometimes simply sitting down (in a safe location) and repeating a calming mantra can help. Vivid flashbacks can occur while someone is awake or asleep. They are often triggered by a sensation of some sort, such as an image or sound. For example, a person with PTSD due to a car accident might suffer a flashback after seeing headlights at night. Reliving moments can also be triggered by contact with someone who was present at the trauma or who looks similar. These types of flashbacks are not only disturbing. They are also problematic due to the fact that they often distract a sufferer from everyday life or activities.\\n2. v4-460px-Be-Comfortable-with-the-Fact-that-You-Blush-Easily-Step-9.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Earn-Money-when-You-Have-Social-Anxiety-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\\n4. Feelings of anxiety and depression that last this long can often be indicators of PTSD, especially if they are tied to a traumatic event. Your primary care physician will likely ask you questions about your mindset and daily activities. Then, if they believe PTSD is a possibility, they will give you a referral to a licensed therapist. PTSD is a mental health condition that's triggered by either experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the triggering event. It's important to get professional medical attention to PTSD because it's not likely to go away without treatment. If you suspect that you have PTSD, but your doctor disagrees, there is nothing wrong with seeking a second opinion. You must be your own best mental health advocate, as not all general practitioners will be familiar with diagnosing or treating PTSD.\\n5. v4-460px-Travel-the-World-As-an-Introvert-Step-19.jpg\", 'question_id': 10024314, 'answer_choices': [[3, 2, 1, 4, 0, 5], [4, 3, 1, 5, 0, 2], [3, 5, 2, 0, 1, 4], [1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 0]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10024547.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

In many cases, a dentist will fit you with a temporary set of dentures while your final set is being created. Make sure to let your dentist know if the temporary set is uncomfortable or ill-fitting. Some dentists will create an impression of your mouth, which will then be used to mold your dentures.\\n1. v4-460px-Buy-Dentures-Step-2.jpg\\n2. Not all dentists are comfortable with fitting and repairing dentures. Ask your current dentist or primary practice doctor for recommendations. Then, ask potential dentists about how frequently they fit dentures and about their professional training. A dentist who specializes in dental prosthetics, including dentures, is called a prosthodontist. You can locate a prosthodontist in your area by going to the website for the American College of Prosthodontists at https://www.gotoapro.org/why-see-a-prosthodontist/. It’s also a good idea to choose a dentist who is relatively near you, as fitting your dentures may require multiple visits.', 'question_id': 10024547, 'answer_choices': [[1, 0, 2], [2, 1, 0], [0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 1]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/100245.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Cernit is the strongest of the polymer clays. Cernit has a porcelain, waxy finish when fired and is often used for doll-making because of its high quality when fired. Though Cernit is the strongest of the clays, it is not as difficult to condition as Fimo. If you have delicate hands, choose Cernit over Fimo to go easy on your hands while still ensuring sturdiness.\\n1. This is the most widely-available polymer clay and the most popular among clay artists. Fimo comes in 58g (2 ounces) and 350g (12.5 ounces) packages. It is the stiffest of the clays and the most difficult to condition. Fimo\\'s firmness lets it hold very fine detail, and smearing is rare. This is important to consider if you plan on painting your rose after crafting it. When fired, Fimo is very strong. It has a slightly glossy surface. It also buffs well and develops a high shine. This brand of clay also comes in a beautiful selection of colors, including two transparent clays, six \"stone\" textured clays, a glow-in-the-dark clay, and metallic colored clay (\"perglantz\").

This is actually the best possible way to allow your skin to heal. If you cover your ringworm with bandages or makeup, you run the risk of suffocating the skin and spreading the infection. The moisture held against the skin can also slow down the healing process.

Take a deep breath, smile, thank them for their time, and move on. Taking a “kill them with kindness” approach has a couple of benefits. First, it protects the reputation of your company or your team. Second, the more you maintain a positive attitude, the more people will see how ungrateful your customer or coworker has been.\\n3. Whether it\\'s your boss, a coworker or a customer, dealing with an ungrateful person in the workplace can be incredibly frustrating. Getting angry or losing your temper with that person will only make things worse, though. Take a deep breath, and let your rage go as you exhale. You can still be frustrated internally, but try to avoid an emotional outburst. If the person is constantly pushing your buttons or won’t let a situation pass, try excusing yourself until you’re able to calm down. If the person is harassing you, don’t be afraid to ask your manager to intervene.\\n4. Sometimes other people don’t always see how much time and energy goes into helping them. Instead of thinking about what you’ve done, think about what your customers or coworkers can actually see. Are they able to see how much work you’ve done to help them? If people don’t know what you’ve done to help, they can’t be expected to show their appreciation. Sometimes it’s part of any role that you have to put in effort without seeing immediate reward. For example, you may have spent the morning putting out all new inventory, but a customer who just walked in wouldn\\'t know that. When they ask if you have other sizes in the back, let them know, \"I put out everything we have this morning.

Researching the topic beforehand will help you understand the problem, allowing you to come up with helpful solutions. Memorizing specific facts and statistics will help you be more persuasive and knowledgeable when discussing the topic with others.\\n3. By having lots of people write letters to lawmakers about the issue of hunger in the US, lawmakers will see how many people want change. To start your letter campaign, you can look up websites to help you with the process, such as https://help.actionnetwork.org/hc/en-us/articles/203112829-Creating-letter-campaigns.

You can post scholarly or news articles about hunger in the US on Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn, encouraging people to read them. You could also post links to interviews about the issue, or just post a couple of facts about the issue of hunger to get people thinking about it.

Stick a spare key in the pill container. Plant it in the lawn near the back of your house or somewhere out of the way. Don’t bury it too deeply. The white top of the pill bottle should be parallel with the surface of the ground. Place a fist-sized rock over the pill bottle in a location where it would not seem out of place. This will allow you to hide a spare key outside your home. In the event you’re locked out, you can get back in by using this key. Hiding the key in the pill bottle protects it from rain, which could cause it to rust.\\n1. v4-460px-Reuse-Empty-Pill-Bottles-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n2. Matches have their own proper place – the matchbook or the matchbox. But if you’re taking matches out camping and get caught in a squall, your matches could be ruined.

Don’t forget to cut the striker off the matchbox or matchbook and tuck it into the pill bottle along with the matches.\\n3. If you spend a lot of time in the kitchen and have a large collection of frosting piping tips, sort them by size. Label a corresponding number of pill bottles with the various piping tip sizes or descriptions. For instance, if you have three piping tips that excrete a star shape, write “star” on the bottle cap and stick the piping tips in the empty pill bottle.\\n4. v4-460px-Reuse-Empty-Pill-Bottles-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Reuse-Empty-Pill-Bottles-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\\n6. v4-460px-Reuse-Empty-Pill-Bottles-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n7. v4-460px-Reuse-Empty-Pill-Bottles-Step-12-Version-2.jpg\\n8. Cotton swabs are great for cleaning small tubes and fine objects. But their small size also makes them hard to store. Most people just keep them in the box they come packaged in, but if you wanted to keep them somewhere more accessible, you could just store them in an empty pill bottle. If you are not able to seal the pill bottle with the lid, that’s okay. You can just leave the pill bottle on your bathroom counter and recycle the lid, or place it somewhere for safekeeping (in the event that you ever want to put your empty pill bottle to a different use).\\n9. Before you reuse your pill bottle, heat up some water to boiling, pour it in the bottle, and wait 60 seconds. Peel the label off, then rinse and dry the empty pill bottle before using it.\\n10. Dab a cotton ball with petroleum jelly. Work the petroleum jelly into the cotton ball by pushing it across the surface with your fingers. Wad the cotton ball up and stuff it in an empty pill bottle. Take the pill bottle on your next camping trip. Cotton coated with petroleum jelly will burn longer than will regular cotton, so it’s a good way to get your fires started. You should be able to fit three or four such cotton balls into your empty pill bottle.

Blind rivets can be installed from 1 side and create secure fastenings without the hammering process necessary for solid rivet installation. Standard blind rivets are the most affordable type and are great for holes that are regularly shaped and aligned properly. Use standard blind rivets for securing metal pieces that aren't going to carry lots of weight. To determine the maximum weight your rivets can hold, look at the back of the package for their shear strength. Never use standard rivets for situations that require a water-proof seal. If you're working with important structural joints, don't use blind rivets. Instead, use solid rivets with a pneumatic rivet gun.\\n1. Dome head rivets are the most common type for pop guns due to their versatility and simple application. They're best used for situations that require reliability and safety. For example, thousands of dome head rivets are used to create the structural frame of modern aircraft. If you're unsure of the applicability of dome heads for your situation, take a look at their packaging to determine the shear strength (listed as weight in pounds) that they can support. Use dome heads when connecting material similar to carbon steel, when the rivet is close to the edge of the material you are fastening. These blind rivets are also called round heads.\\n2. v4-460px-Use-a-Rivet-Gun-Step-2.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Use-a-Rivet-Gun-Step-6.jpg\\n4. Sealed rivets possess an enclosed mandrel (the longer end) that creates a water-tight seal upon installation. They can fasten many kinds of materials and perform well across varying temperature fluctuations and thicknesses. If you don't need a water-tight seal, opt for standard rivets instead—they're typically cheaper than sealed products.\\n5. There are many different kinds of rivet materials. Always match the rivet to the type of metal you're attaching whenever possible. For example, aluminum metal should be fastened with aluminum rivets. If you're fastening leather with a rivet, always use copper, aluminum, or brass. Steel rivets will rust due to leather's tendency to retain moisture. Steel mandrels have a tendency to corrode, and can also create a reaction with surrounding materials. Avoid purchasing rivets that are made from steel mandrels paired with a stainless steel or aluminum body. Purchase a variety pack for a wide selection of rivets of different sizes and materials.\\n6. v4-460px-Use-a-Rivet-Gun-Step-4.jpg\", 'question_id': 10025950, 'answer_choices': [[5, 2, 0, 6, 1, 4, 3], [4, 3, 2, 6, 5, 0, 1], [3, 4, 5, 2, 0, 6, 1], [0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/100263.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

Make sure you leave extra space between each letter. Then draw an outline, using straight lines, around each letter to make it bigger and create the block effect. Erase the original letter lines. Use a marker to bold the new lines. Leave the letters as they are, or color them in. Add fun patterns like polka dots, zigzags, or checkers inside the letters to really make them stand out. To make bubble letters, follow the same steps as block lettering, but make all of the points and corners of the letters rounded instead of straight edges. You could also write the recipient's name in cursive or calligraphy.

Instead, try a problem-oriented statement such as, \"Bedwetting can be very uncomfortable and disruptive for people who deal with it.\" This supports your child be making it clear the problem is not on their shoulders alone. Offer supportive statements such as \"It\\'s great that you\\'re willing to discuss this issue with me. I really appreciate that you\\'re such a mature, honest kid.\"\\n3. If your child is old enough to be resistant to wearing diapers, than they likely have some good reasons. Maybe they are feeling ashamed or embarrassed. Or maybe the diapers are physically uncomfortable. Whatever the issue, make sure that you treat it as a valid concern. One great way to demonstrate that you are hearing their concerns is to use paraphrasing. For instance, you might say, \"I hear you saying that you are concerned your older brother will make fun of you for wearing diapers.\" Follow up with questions. Try saying, \"What could we do to make you feel better about the situation?\"\\n4. v4-460px-Encourage-Older-Children-and-Teenagers-to-Wear-Diapers-for-Bedwetting-Step-5-Version-2.jpg', 'question_id': 1003021, 'answer_choices': [[1, 0, 3, 4, 2], [0, 3, 1, 4, 2], [4, 3, 0, 2, 1], [2, 3, 4, 0, 1]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10030332.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Use-a-Heat-Pump-Step-4.jpg\\n1.

You can order finger lime seeds from your local nursery or online, but keep in mind that most trees take up to 15 years to mature to the point of producing fruit. If you do opt to plant seeds, make sure to use fresh ones. Even with fresh seeds, the finger lime tree is slow to grow and seedlings have a low success rate. Plant seeds in a cell tray with drains about 2 inches (51 mm) deep in the soil. Use your finger to make the hole, then drop a seed into it. Cover it back up with soil. Keep in bright sun (or under a sun lamp) and water every 3-4 days, keeping the soil moist. Once seeds start to sprout, you can replant them in individual pots. Continue moving the seedlings to larger and larger pots as they grow.\\n2. v4-460px-Grow-Finger-Limes-Step-4.jpg\\n3. While the finger lime can withstand light frost, it will freeze and die if left out in temperatures in the 30–40 °F (−1–4 °C) range. Planting it in a pot will allow you to move it indoors when the weather gets cold. Use a 5 US gal (19 L) pot for your finger lime tree. This will give it room to expand and grow roots as the years pass. Make sure there is a hole in the bottom for drainage. Fill your pot with soil and then push the dirt in the middle to the sides to bury the roots of your tree. Add more soil around the base of your plant until the pot is full. The soil should fill the pot but should not be packed down. The tree should be able to stand firmly on its own without support. If it doesn’t, you haven’t planted it deep enough.\\n4. A small tree will cost about $70. Even if it starts out small, your tree will yield fruit in 1 to 2 years, depending on when you are able to plant it.

If you have written a work of fiction, including something about the main character can help you to create a compelling title. If your book focuses on the comments or role of one person or narrator, consider using this as a way to draw in your reader. For example, The Catcher in the Rye introduces a mysterious figure that symbolizes the book’s protagonist. Use a primary character in the title to grab potential readers. For example, in addition to Caulfield’s Catcher, Beverly Cleary’s Ramona Quimby, Age 8 in children’s literature gives us the name of the protagonist with a bit of context.\\n2. v4-460px-Create-the-Perfect-Title-for-Your-Book-Step-11.jpg\\n3.

For example, Gone with the Wind or Monsters of Men\\n4. Check which titles are best sellers in your specific genre to inspire yourself title writing process. In addition, this step can help you avoid using or plagiarizing someone else’s title. Consider where you plan to market your book. Will this be for the general public or for the academic community? Or both? Look at different titles in your field that market to each of these different groups. Run searches on Internet search engines and other databases such as JSTOR for academics or IMDB for fiction. Not only can this help you gain perspective on the title landscape of your field, but also give you further ideas. Read bestseller lists from sources such as the The New York Review of Books or The London Review of Books. Remember that you want your title to be as original as possible so that it doesn’t get lost in a crowd of other intriguing books.\\n5. v4-460px-Create-the-Perfect-Title-for-Your-Book-Step-8.jpg\\n6. As you start thinking about potential titles, make sure that a copy of your book is never far. This can help you peruse and identify keywords, images, dialogue or characters that may spark potential readers’ attention. Recognize that keeping the text close for finding a title may also help you refine the text. Refer to it any time you are unsure of something; the lines may inspire you. Figure out major elements of the book such as the narrator or the overall argument. Ask yourself how these elements figure into a powerful title. Remember that the title isn’t a simple label, but rather a way for readers to first access your work.\\n7. v4-460px-Create-the-Perfect-Title-for-Your-Book-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n8. v4-460px-Create-the-Perfect-Title-for-Your-Book-Step-1-Version-2.jpg\\n9. Take some time to notice if there are contradictory themes or situations in your book. Comparing and juxtaposing these elements in a short and simple title can help you get at the essence of your book, and grab potential readers’ attention.

Some examples include: War and Peace, which details personal lives between situations of war and peace; Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared contrasts two dictatorships that are often paralleled to get at their unique features; and The Drowned and the Saved uses juxtaposition to get at those who survived and those who fell victim to the Holocaust.', 'question_id': 1003185, 'answer_choices': [[8, 0, 2, 6, 9, 4, 1, 7, 3, 5], [4, 8, 6, 2, 1, 7, 3, 0, 9, 5], [7, 1, 3, 4, 6, 5, 8, 9, 2, 0], [0, 2, 9, 7, 4, 5, 3, 8, 6, 1]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1003195.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

This can be done in two ways: create your own mini-library at home by collecting dozens of books in your child’s reading level, or make weekly trips to the local public library together to check out books.

As with all things, it's difficult to learn anything without exposure to it. In order to get your child interested in reading, you should be reading to them on a regular basis. If you’re able, this should start when they are an infant and continue through their school years. Read books with stories they comprehend; at a young age this may lead you to read 3-4 small books a day. Books that combine other senses besides listening help your small child to comprehend the story as you read it. For example, read many books that have pictures, tactile pages, sounds, or have accompanying scents.

Some companies have advertised specialized flashcards to help babies, toddlers, and preschool age children to read. In general, flashcards are not the most useful or effective technique for teaching reading skills. Time spent reading stories with your child will be much more beneficial than flashcards. “Reading aloud to young children, particularly in an engaging manner, promotes emergent literacy and language development and supports the relationship between child and parent. In addition it can promote a love for reading which is even more important than improving specific literacy skills.”\\n4. v4-460px-Teach-Your-Child-to-Read-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Teach-Your-Child-to-Read-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\\n6. It’s no good if you have books around, but located in places that your child can’t easily take them. Keep books low to the ground and in typical play-areas so that your child begins to associate them with play activities. Because your child may be touching and reading the books often, be sure to choose ones that have wipeable pages and that aren’t incredibly sentimental. Pop-up books may not be the best option for young children. A fancy bookshelf may seem like the most attractive option, but until your child is in school focus on the utilitarian purposes of book storage. Set up a reading space next to the bookshelf. Set some beanbags, pillows, and comfy chairs around to sit in while reading.

You want to place your foam directly on top of your cardboard surface so that all the sides line up. After you cut the foam, remove the paper protecting the adhesive and apply it to the top of your cardboard. If the foam you find doesn\\'t have adhesive, you\\'ll want to glue the foam in place. You should be able to find this type of foam at any hobby or craft store. If you don\\'t want to use foam, you can just leave the cardboard plain, as it will still function as a mousepad. Alternatively, you can use something like a piece of cork as this layer of your mousepad. If you have an old bulletin board, simply cut out a piece the size of your pad. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.wikihow.com\\\\/images\\\\/thumb\\\\/f\\\\/ff\\\\/Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-3-Version-3.jpg\\\\/v4-460px-Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-3-Version-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.wikihow.com\\\\/images\\\\/thumb\\\\/f\\\\/ff\\\\/Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-3-Version-3.jpg\\\\/v4-760px-Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-3-Version-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\\\"mw-parser-output\\\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\\\"nofollow\\\\\" class=\\\\\"external text\\\\\" href=\\\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/creativecommons.org\\\\/licenses\\\\/by-nc-sa\\\\/3.0\\\\/\\\\\">Creative Commons<\\\\/a><br>\\\\n<\\\\/p><p><br \\\\/>\\\\n<\\\\/p><\\\\/div>\"},\\n2. v4-460px-Make-a-Homemade-Computer-Mousepad-Step-2-Version-3.jpg', 'question_id': 1003358, 'answer_choices': [[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 0], [0, 2, 1], [0, 2, 1]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1003383.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

Don’t look up or to the left or right out of the corners of your eyes. These are all tells which are little clues to your opponents that you have something to hide, whether it’s a good hand of cards or bad. It’s hard to do, but minimize your eye movements. Even squinting or excessive eyebrow raises can give away your reaction.\\n2. Your face is the first giveaway that could cost you a game of poker. Keeping your emotions and reactions in check regarding hands dealt to you is a key part of poker. Any type of expression sacrifices your power in situations with your opponents. Clear your mind, wiggle your face to loosen the muscles, take a deep breath, and relax. You want to be in control of the situation and if you’re too stressed, you can lose that control. Hiding your reactions is power because no one knows what you’re thinking or what you’re about to do.\\n3. Staring into space or focusing too hard on your cards is also how your poker face can be compromised. It either shows that you aren’t paying attention, or that you’re concerned for your hand and chances. Remind yourself to blink so that your eyes don’t dry out while you concentrate. Excessive blinking can also show nervousness, so don’t go overboard. There’s a balance between blinking enough to keep from staring and keeping your eyes focused so they don’t flit around. Staring too hard can also cause your shoulders to bunch up and posture to suffer. Focusing too hard on one thing visually can also distract you and you may miss an important play.\\n4. v4-460px-Have-a-Good-Poker-Face-Step-4-Version-4.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Have-a-Good-Poker-Face-Step-2-Version-4.jpg', 'question_id': 100340, 'answer_choices': [[2, 5, 3, 4, 1, 0], [0, 5, 3, 4, 1, 2], [3, 1, 0, 4, 5, 2], [4, 3, 5, 1, 2, 0]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1003552.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. While it may seem counter intuitive, the best way to take your mind off of problems in the long term is to confront and overcome them. Otherwise, the same issues will continue to crop up and cause anxiety until they are dealt with. Ruminating -- a tendency to replay anxious thoughts over and over in your mind -- is a mental habit that has to be broken. Begin by allowing yourself to consider the root source of your anxious thoughts. What is the scenario you fear most, and why do you worry about it? After you have identified the source of your anxiety, let yourself imagine the worst-case scenario. Often we let open-ended scenarios frighten us, when in reality we can handle the worst-case scenario. Ask yourself, what is the worst thing that can happen, and can I handle it?\\n1. Contrary to what you might see on TV, meditation doesn't have to be complicated, spooky, or mystical. Lots of ordinary people practice simple varieties of meditation to help calm their minds. Meditation is about developing the discipline to quiet or focus your mind. Start by sitting in a comfortable, quiet room free of distractions. Sit in a position that is comfortable for you, but keep a straight back and good posture. Use a chair if you prefer. Close your eyes gently and breathe naturally in and out through your nose. Focus your attention on the way the air feels entering your nose, then your throat, then your lungs; and then on how it feels leaving again. If you find it hard to focus on your breath and your mind starts to wander, just gently redirect your thoughts back to your breath. You can do this for just a few minutes and then gradually increase the time you spend clearing your mind.\\n2. v4-460px-Take-Your-Mind-off-Things-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Take-Your-Mind-off-Things-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\", 'question_id': 1003552, 'answer_choices': [[0, 1, 2, 3], [2, 1, 3, 0], [1, 3, 2, 0], [0, 3, 1, 2]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1003596.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Kiss-a-Stranger-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Kiss-a-Stranger-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n2. If you’re in a bar or restaurant that you often go to, ask whether he/she is a fan of some category of food or drink that they serve (for example red wine, a variety of beer, or any kind of food such as nachos, or fried meat). If the person says yes, then recommend something to them, making sure to point out what’s so great about it. If the person says they don't like it, you can either try to convince them that they should try it, or ask what they do like, and try to find some common ground, or a discussion point.

If you’re in a new place, ask if the person goes there a lot, and whether they have any recommendations. If they say they haven’t been there before, you can still ask their advice about what they think is likely to be good.\\n3. Pay attention to things like body language and how the person is behaving, especially whether they're interacting with the people around them. If they're alone, and looking around the room interestingly, then they might be looking for someone to talk to. However, they might also be looking for a person they're planning on meeting there. Try to notice whether they're just being observant or whether they seem to be searching for something in particular, for example, they might be craning their neck to get a good look at something that's difficult for them to see.

This may be a few basic resolutions or an involved regime. Overall, try to eat a balanced diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains. Consume moderate amounts of proteins (like meat, fish, eggs, and beans) and milk products, and keep high-fat and sugary foods to a minimum.

There are many brands of conditioner, hair spray, shine spray, and heat protector that are designed to prevent your hair from frizzing. It also helps to try hair care products (shampoo, conditioner) that are as natural as possible and don't contain things like sulfates or mineral oil. Some of these products will only de-frizz your hair temporarily, but others will have gradual, permanent ant-frizz effects if you use them over time. There are products like sprays or gels that you use while your hair is dry and after you have styled it. These types of products are temporary, and will not have any permanent effects on your hair.

Let her express her anger over the breakup. You can provide her a healthy outlet for this by listening to her with empathy. She is allowed to say whatever she wants about her ex, and you can nod and encourage her to tell you more. You need to tread lightly about what you say about her ex, however. Do not go on a tirade about her ex and all the things you didn’t like about them, because it may make her feel worse that she was “blind” to all of these terrible things.

This is a loss and she will not bounce back from it overnight. It takes time to heal. Helping her understand the grieving process will give her perspective on her emotions. Encourage her to learn about grief and look at her feelings as a process she needs to go through, not feelings that will be around forever. For example, you could say, “You have been through a big loss, and your heart and mind are processing this loss. It takes a lot of energy to grieve a loss, but you have to work your way through it.

As her parent, you might hope it will be you, but understand that as long as you know she is talking to friends or someone else she trusts, do not force her to talk to you about it. Still, you can do your best to encourage her to talk to you with these strategies:\\nBe ready to listen to her wherever and whenever, even if it is inconvenient for you. She is in a crisis mode right now, so now is not the time to tell her “We’ll talk after dinner,” or put off the conversation. Drop what you are doing and be ready to listen. Listen without judgment. Don’t provide opinions on what you are hearing. It may be obvious to you that this breakup is a very positive thing in your daughter’s life, for example, but now is not the time to let her know that. Instead, focus on listening to your daughter and try to be accepting of what she says. Avoid offering a “silver lining” response. Reinforce that talking about it is healthy and will help her feel better. Express to your daughter that it’s okay that if she doesn’t want to talk to you about the breakup, but encourage her to be talking to others about it. Do not be pushy about making her talk to you if she doesn’t feel like it. Try saying, “I know how upset you are. When you’re upset, it’s really important to let those sad feelings out by talking to someone. Don’t keep them bottled up inside. It’s okay if you don’t want to talk to me about it.

All kinds of objects may be used to decorate gelatin. Choose an object that fits with your party's theme and coordinates well with the color of your gelatin. Other factors to consider include the following:\\nMake sure the object is lightweight enough to be suspended in gelatin. Heavy objects may simply sink to the bottom. Flowers, small plastic or rubber toys, or fruit that has been carved into a decorative shape are all good options. Use a decoration that is composed of parts that won't fall apart or dissolve when heated. You don't want to choose something made of wood, cloth, or another soft, porous material.

The only exception is if you want to make a gelatin mold as a Halloween decoration; in that case, go crazy with rubber spiders and snakes. Most importantly, choose a decoration that is nontoxic. This is extremely important, since you'll be pouring hot liquid gelatin over the object, which will distribute particles of the item throughout the mold. Fresh flowers and fruit are a safe bet. If you want to use a plastic or rubber toy, choose one that's nontoxic; items that are safe for a baby or toddler to chew on are safe enough to use in a gelatin mold.\\n2. The shape of the mold you choose is almost as important as the flavor and the decoration inside. You could use a simple household item, like a bowl, or go for something fancier. Consider the following options:\\nA bowl with an interesting shape. Instead of using a basic round bowl, choose one that has unique indentations or a pattern of some kind. Individual molds.

The average family that uses propane to heat their home uses around 1,200 gallons (4,500 L) each year.

Additionally, look for serums with rose hip oil. This also reduces redness and helps hydrate the skin.\", 'question_id': 10041412, 'answer_choices': [[5, 2, 7, 6, 4, 3, 1, 0], [2, 0, 7, 4, 6, 3, 5, 1], [7, 0, 6, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5], [1, 3, 4, 2, 7, 6, 0, 5]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1004141.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Writing a love letter is a truly romantic way to show a girl you love her and is something she can cherish forever. This is an especially good option if you have difficulty verbalizing your feelings - all you need to do is whip out a pen and let your heart do the talking. You can give the letter to her in person or send it by mail for extra surprise factor. Take inspiration from the words of great writers such as Shakespeare, Lord Byron or Emily Dickinson if you have difficulty getting started, or look up some famous, romantic quotes that you can incorporate into your letter. You could also write her a nice email or text message, but there\\'s nothing like snail mail for a bit of old-fashioned romance. Alternatively, if you want to get even more creative you could try putting your feelings into a song or a poem. You could sing the song in person or record it and send it to her if you\\'re feeling a little shy. If you play an instrument already, even better!\\n1. v4-460px-Show-a-Girl-You-Love-Her-Step-4.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Show-a-Girl-You-Love-Her-Step-6.jpg\\n3. Well, duh. If you really love this girl, the easiest, most straight-forward way to show her is just to tell her. You don\\'t need to make a big song and dance about it, or trail a banner with the words \"I love you\" from an airplane, you simply need to take a moment when the two of you are sharing an intimate moment alone and say those three little words, seriously and sincerely. If the exact words \"I love you\" are a little too scary or intense, try saying something to the same effect, such as \"I think I\\'m falling for you\" or something cheesy like \"you\\'ve completely stolen my heart\". She\\'ll get the idea. If it\\'s your first time to say it, don\\'t be too disheartened if she doesn\\'t say it back right away. She may just need a little more time to process the information. Remember that \"I love you\" is not a question that demands an answer. On the other hand, she might be completely over the moon that you\\'ve finally mustered up the courage to tell her how you feel and jump at the opportunity to return the words she\\'s been longing to hear. You\\'ll never know until you go for it!\\n4. This is an easy one. If you really love this girl it should be no problem to find 101 things you like about her and can compliment her on. You can compliment her on her appearance: whether it\\'s something she prides herself on, like her long, shiny hair or amazing green eyes, or something that she feels self-conscious about, like her curves or crooked smile. You shouldn\\'t just focus on her appearance though, you should also compliment her on her best personality traits or something she\\'s done well on. For example, you could tell her that you love her kind heart and the way she\\'s always doing things for others, or compliment her on what a great job she did at a recent sports event or on a particular homework assignment. Compliments should always be sincere. If you tell her something that\\'s not true, she may be able to tell that the compliment is fake and the whole thing will backfire completely. Keep it genuine and heartfelt.\\n5. v4-460px-Show-a-Girl-You-Love-Her-Step-2.jpg\\n6. It may seem clichéd, but nothing says \"I love you\" like a beautiful bunch of flowers. However, you should try to put a little effort into it - don\\'t just pick up the first bunch that\\'s on sale at the supermarket. Go the extra mile by finding out from friends or family what type of flowers are her favorite and have them specially delivered to her home. For added romance and to charm her, you can attach a romantic note to the flowers. It can be something short and sweet like \"beautiful flowers for a beautiful girl\" or something a little lengthier, like a romantic quote from a poem or song. If you\\'re short on cash, don\\'t worry. You don\\'t need to buy the most expensive, imported flowers available. In fact, a single red rose or a freshly-picked bunch of wildflowers can be infinitely more romantic than a generic, pre-arranged bouquet.

Before making an active search for an internship, you should have a resume already written. This will speed up the process of applying when you find something you like. You will also need to have a copy of your resume when doing certain types of searches, such as if you go to a job fair. Be sure that your resume is appropriately structured and looks professional. Consider building your work experience first. If you have no work experience, it may be worth it to consider building work experience before attempting to get an internship. Many internships are competitive and you will be unlikely to get one with no work history. Consider volunteering or an entry-level position.\\n4. Many high schools, colleges, and universities will have career centers where you can search for an internship. Many times, these centers will be staffed with volunteers or employees who can help you in your search, give you advice, and help you write your resume and cover letters. Such resources are often also available to alumni.\\n5. Many career fields will have professional organizations or associations or regionalized branches of those groups. These will often have online job postings or postings in their offices. Call the organization appropriate for your field and ask if they provide any information regarding internship openings.\\n6. v4-460px-Find-an-Internship-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n7.

You need a travel visa to visit Zhangjiajie if you don't already live in China. China has several different visa categories based on the purpose of your trip. To figure out what documents you need, visit your country’s Chinese embassy website. Select the applicable visa category, browse the requirements, and complete the applications and outlined instructions. Apply for your visa within 90 days of your arrival date. For example, if you are traveling from the United States and you want to visit as a tourist, you need an L visa. To get an L visa, you need proof of legal residence in addition to a valid passport and completed application.

All the flowers come to life, and the mountains are super green. The summer is considered the rainy season in Zhangjiajie, but the temperatures warm up. The spring season is relatively less crowded, although it gets very busy from May through August. This is a great time to visit if you plan on hiking the mountains. You can still see some icicles off of cliffs and mountains in the early springtime months. Since school is out, this is a popular time for tourists and locals to visit.\\n5. v4-460px-Visit-Zhangjiajie-Step-4.jpeg\\n6.

PM is rare, but anyone can develop it at any time. It’s more likely to develop in females than males, and usually doesn’t occur in people under age 20. Most people are in their 30s to 50s when PM emerges. PM isn’t passed down genetically, but your genes may influence your likelihood of developing the condition. Certain viruses like HIV might also be triggers, but the truth is that PM usually occurs without explanation. For some reason, your immune system starts attacking healthy muscle tissue. While viruses like HIV can be connected to PM, it is more likely to develop in people with other autoimmune conditions, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.\\n2. Sore muscles are a part of everyone’s life. However, muscle weakness that gradually worsens over a few weeks to a month may be a sign of PM. The possibility of PM further increases if the muscle weakness is widespread and on both sides of your body. PM most commonly occurs in the muscles of your shoulders, upper arms, hips, thighs, and neck. The muscles closest to your trunk will be affected the most. You might also experience pain, tenderness or swelling in these muscles. You will feel these symptoms, along with muscle weakness, equally on both sides of the body.\\n3. v4-460px-Choose-Hypertension-Medication-Step-2-Version-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10044827, 'answer_choices': [[1, 3, 0, 2], [0, 2, 1, 3], [2, 0, 1, 3], [2, 1, 0, 3]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10045887.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

High-quality personal relationships are defined by closeness, respect, shared values and support. Studies have shown that quality personal relationships not only help our mental health but also contribute to our physical well-being. Spend quality time together engaging in meaningful activities. For example, go on a walk, visit a museum, or just sit and have a conversation.\\n2. Humans are social creatures by nature, even introverts. For this reason, you may need to take opportunities to interact with others if you want to build healthy relationships with others. Find reasons to put yourself in contact with other people. The more times you do this, the more likely that you will interact with others, and the more likely those interactions will be meaningful. Go out. Go to a coffee shop, Take a trip. Attend a concert or play. Find meet-ups. Find groups in your community that share your values and interests and go to events they host. Meetup.com is a great resource for this, but there are others you can find through a brief online search. Be available. Make yourself say \"yes\" to invitations from acquaintances, coworkers, family, and friends. This can be as simple as lunch on a Friday, to camping on the weekend, to attending a child\\'s dance recital. It doesn\\'t matter what you\\'ve been invited to. Provided it doesn\\'t interfere with necessary weekly responsibilities, just say \"yes.\"\\n3. This isn\\'t simply doing sweet things for others, like giving gifts, but how you interact with others day to day. Treating others with genuine kindness and respect is an integral part of building a healthy connection. Trusting someone and deepening your relationship requires vulnerability, and it will be difficult for anyone to be vulnerable with you if they think you may mock them or treat them badly. Kindness, on the other hand, makes people feel valued and cared for. One instance in which can be difficult to show kindness is during conflict. Instead of blaming, yelling, calling the person names or exploiting their insecurities, choose instead to express why you are hurt and angry.\\n4. v4-460px-Be-a-Beautiful-Black-Teenage-Girl-Step-17.jpg', 'question_id': 1004679, 'answer_choices': [[1, 0, 2, 3, 4], [2, 4, 1, 0, 3], [1, 2, 0, 4, 3], [3, 2, 0, 1, 4]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10047594.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Consider their religion and its tenets regarding common cremation or burial procedures. For example, division is not recommended by the Catholic Church, as they treat remains as a single body.

If the deceased left behind a Will, the Executor appointed within it has a moral duty to ensure that their wishes are respected. However, they are not legally bound to do so. If your loved one didn't leave any specific burial wishes behind, try and think of something they would like.

TSH tells your thyroid to produce hormones called T3 and T4. If your TSH levels are low and your T3 and T4 levels are high, your thyroid is overactive.

They might also test for antibodies, which would indicate an infection, or perform a radioactive iodine uptake scan to see if your thyroid is overactive. When the pituitary gland produces higher levels of TSH, it usually means the thyroid isn’t making enough hormones. Low TSH levels usually mean the thyroid is producing too many hormones.

Voltaren Gel comes with a dosing card to help you apply the correct amount. Use the rectangular area to measure out the dosage to the 2 g (0.071 oz) or 4 g (0.14 oz) line. You’ll squeeze out the gel inside the rectangular area, being careful to stick to the right measurements. If you’re applying the gel to your upper extremities (elbow, wrist, or hand), then you’ll apply 2 g (0.071 oz). If you’re applying the gel to your lower extremities (knee, ankle, or foot), apply 4 g (0.14 oz). Make sure your skin is clean and dry before applying the gel to the affected area.

The amount of salt you need depends on the thickness and weight of your particular material. Measure out your salt and pour it into your warm water, then mix it up using a spoon. The salt helps the dye penetrate the fabric and stay permanently. To find out how much your fabric weighs, read the packaging if it's a new tablecloth. If its an existing tablecloth, use an online fabric calculator based on your tablecloth's dimensions.\\n1. v4-460px-Dye-Tablecloths-Step-6.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Dye-Tablecloths-Step-4.jpg\\n3. Dunk the tablecloth into your bucket or bin, and use a spoon to push it beneath the liquid. This way, all of the fabric gets saturated in the dye. Leave the dye in the solution for 5-20 minutes, as outlined in your directions. Leave your tablecloth in the dye for a longer period of time for a highly saturated, vibrant look.\\n4. Turn on your faucet to the coldest setting, and wash away the dye from your tablecloth. Continue washing the material until the water runs clear. Then, wring out any extra water, and hang your tablecloth on an outdoor clothesline to dry. You can use your garden hose or your sink to rinse your fabric. If you don’t have a clothesline, you can lay your tablecloth over your porch railing or banister.\\n5. v4-460px-Dye-Tablecloths-Step-2.jpg\\n6.

More than 30 countries are members of the Hague Convention. This includes most European countries as well as some others, such as Brazil and Turkey. While you must at least know the country where the parent is located, it isn\\'t necessary to know their exact location under the Hague Convention. Once you submit your application, the country will determine the parent\\'s location. In most cases, your child support case worker will assist you with this process. Contact your case worker and let them know where your child\\'s other parent currently lives. You can also check the list of Hague Convention countries at https://www.acf.hhs.gov/css/partners/international.\\n2. If the child\\'s other parent owes back child support payments, your application must include a statement of how much is owed as of the date of the application. You typically must convert these amounts to local currency. Your child support case worker may assist with this calculation.

If the country didn\\'t begin enforcement actions until after the challenge period ended, or if your child\\'s other parent challenged enforcement of the child support order, they may now owe more money than they did when you submitted your application. Typically these calculations will be done by your local child support agency. The child support enforcement authority in the country where your child\\'s other parent currently lives will reach out to you or to your child support case worker to get updated figures. The child support enforcement authority will provide information to you on how the payments will be collected and dispersed to you. If you previously received payments through your local child support agency, payment typically will be made directly to that agency.\\n5. v4-460px-Adopt-a-Child-of-Another-Race-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\\n6. v4-460px-File-for-Child-Custody-in-Oregon-Step-22.jpg\\n7. A Transmittal form and application must be completed and sent to the designated child support authority in the country where the child\\'s other parent lives. Other forms may be required depending on the circumstances under which your order was entered. For example, you must include a \"Statement of Proper Notice\" if the child\\'s other parent did not appear in court when the child support order was entered. This form certifies that the child\\'s other parent had sufficient legal notice of the court proceeding. Hague Convention forms, along with a description of when each form is required, are available for download at https://www.acf.hhs.gov/css/resource/hague-child-support-convention-forms.\\n8.

After paper is shredded, it is still viable for recycling and there is no security risk in doing this. If the amount of shredded material will fit into your home recycling bin, its fine to put it in there. If you have a large volume of shredded material, it’s better to take it to a recycling agency yourself.\\n2. v4-460px-Dispose-of-Paper-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n3. Paper shredders come in a variety of shapes, sizes and qualities. In general, the most effective shredders are usually those with the higher price tags. These also tend to be able to shred a higher volume of paper more efficiently. Which shredder you choose entirely depends on your needs. Any office supply store will carry a range of shredders for both home and office use. If you are shredding large amounts of paper, get the best shredder that you can afford. Low priced shredders tend to only allow you to shred one or two documents at a time, feeding them in slowly by hand. If you have a lot of paper to shred, this could take a very long time. If you are shredding documents with highly private or sensitive information, don’t opt for the cheapest shredder solution. A mid-priced home or office shredder is your best bet. This is because the cheaper the shredder, the less effective the shredding mechanism actually is. It may shred in fairly large strips; you’d want to get something higher quality to destroy your sensitive documents.\\n4. Follow the instruction manual carefully. Shredders can jam up very easily if you try to pass through too many documents at once. Check the volume your shredder can handle. Smaller machines can only shred around 5 documents at one time. Bigger machines can handle a lot more. Be sure not to exceed your machine’s shredding capacity. Also check your machine’s manual for items that shouldn’t be shredded. Some of the smaller home machines will jam if you try to shred an envelope with a plastic window. Other machines can easily shred plastic windows, staples, paper clips and even credit cards. If you do exceed capacity or shred the wrong item and end up with a paper jam, all standard machines are equipped with a reverse mode that allows you to remove the jam easily. After you are finished with your shredding, don’t forget to turn the machine off. Leaving it on for excessive amounts of time can overheat its motor. Shredders need to be oiled on a regular basis to keep them working optimally. Many machines provide a small bottle of this when you purchase it. If yours didn’t, you can easily pick this up at any office supply store. To oil the machine, drizzle a small amount of the lubricant through the machine’s feed opening and run your shredder in reverse mode for about 60 seconds. Then switch it back to normal mode and pass a few papers through to absorb any excess oil.', 'question_id': 100497, 'answer_choices': [[3, 0, 4, 2, 1], [2, 4, 3, 0, 1], [0, 2, 3, 1, 4], [4, 1, 2, 0, 3]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10049804.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Wear-a-Wrist-Splint-Step-4.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Wear-a-Wrist-Splint-Step-2.jpg\\n2. Resting splints are usually made of a rigid, molded plastic material and are meant to completely immobilize your wrist in a neutral position. Your splint should relieve pain and swelling by supporting your hand and wrist in a neutral position. Resting splints are intended for use while sleeping or at rest. Under most circumstances, resting splints should be worn overnight while you sleep. Your doctor may recommend that you wear your splint sparingly during the day if you're experiencing flare-ups or have painful joints. Make sure you only wear it as recommended by your doctor. If you wear one for too long or too frequently, your wrist joint will stiffen up and the supporting muscles will weaken due to you not using them.\\n3. If you have been diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), your doctor’s first recommendation may be to wear a resting splint nightly for a month. Roughly one-third of CTS patients find that this treatment alone is enough to reduce their symptoms for at least a year. It’s much easier to bend your wrist awkwardly (in ways that constrict the carpal tunnel in your wrist) for long periods during the night.

While a cup of coffee or tea might pick you up in the morning, too much caffeine later in the day might interfere with your ability to sleep. If you have insomnia, consider avoiding caffeine altogether. You can always drink decaf coffee or a caffeine-free tea, like ginger, chamomile, or hibiscus tea.\\n3. Setting a regular sleep schedule will help you fall asleep faster and improve the quality of your sleep. Aim to get between 7-9 hours of sleep a night if you are an adult, or 8-10 hours if you're a teenager. For example, you might choose to go to bed at 11 pm and wake up at 7 am each morning. This gives you 8 hours of sleep a night. Avoid the urge to stay up late or sleep in on the weekends. This can disrupt your sleep schedule and leave you feeling exhausted.\\n4. Just taking a break and resting for 20 minutes can have a big impact on your energy and mood. Fit in a break somewhere in your day to meditate, stretch, read, listen to calming music, or just relax.

If the water is denser, the egg will float. If the egg doesn\\'t float, add more salt. Make sure to stir until the salt is dissolved.\\n2. Here\\'s a more complete explanation: when table salt (chemical formula NaCl) dissolves in water, it breaks apart into two atoms: sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl). The + and - symbols tell you that these atoms are \"ions,\" meaning they have an electric charge. Since the opposite ends of a water molecule also have electric charges, the ions attract the water molecules closer and form a tight connection.\\n3.

For the most part, you can treat your short shorts like any other type of bottom. If your short shorts have a print, don't wear a patterned top. It's also a bad idea to mix dark neutrals. For example, if your short shorts are navy blue, don't wear a top that's black or dark brown.\\n3. You can wear any type of shoes with short shorts. However, there are a few shoe types that work better than others:\\n\\nSimple flat tennis shoes. Short shorts and tennis shoes are a classic summer look. Stiletto heels. Short shorts will draw attention to your legs, so you want them looking their best. Ultra-high heels will make your legs look longer and more toned. Thigh high boots. This is an extra sexy, on-trend look. Pick boots that are made from a thin material that could pass for stockings.\\n4. The most important part of wearing any type of clothing is its fitting. However, you should pay extra attention to fit when looking for short shorts. A few common problems you want to avoid:\\n\\nMuffin tops. Make sure your short shorts are wide enough at the waist. They shouldn't pinch your stomach. Sliding off. The opposite problem of the muffin top is when your short shorts are too wide at the waist, causing them to sag or slip off. Watch out for this problem if you have narrow hips. Riding up. The wrong pair of short shorts is one that rides up along the thigh. Not only can this be painful, but you may find your butt cheeks hanging out of your shorts.\\n5. v4-460px-Wear-Short-Shorts-Step-6.jpg\\n6.

Smiling at people lets them know that you are pleasant. Look the person in the eye and give them a small smile or a wide grin - it doesn't matter which. This sets the mood of the encounter and usually encourages the other person to smile back. This also helps the person feel comfortable around you. If they do not smile back at you, then maybe they are just having a bad day. That's okay; being nice doesn't guarantee a positive response, but it usually helps. Smile when you pass people in the street, when you buy something from a shop clerk, when you walk into school in the morning, or anytime you make eye contact with someone else. Smile even when you're feeling low. You can still be nice when you're in a bad mood. Why spread your negative energy to other people? If you are in a bad mood and don't want to listen to people, try listening to music, drawing, or something else you enjoy. This can prevent you from acting harshly towards people or being rude (even if you don't mean to be).\\n1. v4-460px-Be-Nice-Step-4-Version-4.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Be-Nice-Step-2-Version-4.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Be-Nice-Step-7-Version-4.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Be-Nice-Step-5-Version-4.jpg\\n5. Being positive will help you stay happy, even if you are having a bad day. A smile improves your outlook, and makes people think of you as a confident and happy person. Smiling at people also helps them feel good about themselves! Besides, nobody likes a person who bores them with his own problems.\\n6. Listen when other people are talking to you. It isn't nice to just ignore other people's opinions and stories. Give them time to speak, just as you'd like them to give you time to speak if your positions were reversed. If you find that someone is becoming rude or pushy, never put your hands in your mouth or make a rude face. Politely wait for them to finish and change the topic, after they've discussed theirs. Being nice doesn't mean letting yourself get pushed around. If you're talking to a stranger who starts to make you uncomfortable, it's okay to excuse yourself and walk away.\\n7. Of course, you shouldn't generally criticize people at all, but there are times when telling someone they did someone wrong is perfectly fine. However, that time is never when the person isn't around. Talking badly about people when they aren't around tells everyone else that you don't respect them, and treat people differently when they are around. Nice people know that talking behind someone's back is never appreciated and can make you appear as a gossip. If you have a problem or question about someone, just ask.

Before going in for shopping, you might organize some of your shopping items based on what items are discounted on that given week. If there is something you wouldn\\'t normally buy that\\'s currently being sold for a steal, it\\'s sometimes a good idea to switch up your buying habits accordingly. On the other hand, if there\\'s a discount for an item you usually buy, you can take the chance to stock up on more of it than you normally would.\\n2.

If your trips are infrequent, it\\'s all the more important to come prepared with a list. On the other hand, if you\\'re going multiple times a week, it won\\'t usually be an issue if you forget an item or two.

Don\\'t be shy – salespeople want you to find the right jewelry. Tell them as much as you can about the person you\\'re buying for, including their likes and dislikes.

Ask them questions like \"What lines are people most excited about?\" and \"Which jewelry lines and styles are your favorite?\" Local and boutique type stores that are on the smaller side are more likely to have salespeople that have close relationships with the manufacturers of the products they sell.

Choose to move on from feelings of resentment. Nothing takes you away from the present like dwelling in the past. To clear your day of resentment, make a list of people who have hurt you, or, if there is one person strongly on your mind, write only that name. Spend some time thinking about how much they hurt you, and what effect that has had on you. Decide to attempt forgiveness. Say it aloud if that sometimes helps you. Ask yourself what you know about the person who hurt you. Try to reconstruct the stresses, pressures, traumas, and fears that this person has experienced. Let go of your anger. Allow yourself to feel compassion for the person who wronged you. You don\\'t have to reconcile them, just let yourself feel some goodwill towards them. Forgiveness can have a positive effect on your health and wellbeing. Choosing to forgive a betrayal can lower your blood pressure, improve your heart health, and diminish anxiety and depression.\\n2. Do work that compels your attention completely. Do not time yourself, but let yourself focus for as long as you naturally can. Play music, read, write, dance, walk, or work on a project or hobby. Flow state means you are in the moment, creative, focused, and undistracted. If you have no work or hobby that can completely occupy your attention, work on developing one. Pick a project that involves your most developed skills and is meaningful to you. Eliminate distractions. Do not check your email, any websites, or your phone while you work. If you were productive, lost track of time, and felt good after working, you were in flow state.\\n3. Go out in the world on foot, weather permitting. Instead of making a plan, let your feet carry you around. Walk to a neighborhood you rarely visit, or a park. Take a bus and walk around somewhere you don\\'t spend much time. Spend as much time on your feet and without a map or a phone as you comfortably can. If you find yourself automatically taking routes you always take, reprogram yourself. For example, take an ordinary route but take a crucial wrong turn. Take a map and draw a shape on it with your eyes closed. Now follow the \"route\" you drew through the city as closely as you safely can. Call a friend and ask them what their favorite point in your town is.

This gives the room a futuristic feel. While you can choose varying shades of a darker grey to decorate the room, this works especially well with a lighter grey so that the room doesn’t become too dark. For example, select dark grey furniture to go with a light grey rug that matches light grey walls. Hang super light grey curtains (almost white) to add some light into the room. Choosing slightly different shades of grey will give the room added depth. You may enjoy monochromatic grey if you'd like your room to look masculine or minimalist. However, you can warm it up by varying the shades and textures you use. For example, you could use a plush, dark grey rug and a soft silver grey throw as warming accents.\\n1. v4-460px-Decorate-Grey-Walls-Step-2.jpg\\n2. A deep purple looks great with a rich grey, while ruby red accents add sophistication to a lighter grey room. Both of these colors create an elegant color scheme and are perfect for smaller accessories. Pick out a large purple vase for an indoor plant, or hang a red light fixture. When using red, avoid choosing a bright shade, which can make your grey take on a muddy effect.\\n3. v4-460px-Decorate-Grey-Walls-Step-4.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Decorate-Grey-Walls-Step-6.jpg\\n5. White is a great color to use in your room to create an open, bright atmosphere, no matter the shade of grey you’re working with. If you want the colors in the room to be white and grey only, pick out white couches, bed linens, drapes, pillows, or other accessories. If your walls are a darker grey, decorating in all whites will be a great way to bring in light. Paint the molding in the room a white or off-white color, or purchase a large white area rug to cover a darker flooring. Choose accessories such as white picture frames, table lamps, or paintings. The glossiness of your white accents also helps create the look you want. For example, shiny white frames or fixtures can create a glamorous look.

Put on facial moisturizing lotion within 3 minutes after you get out of the shower. If you take a shower and don’t moisturize immediately afterward, you’ll risk drying out your skin and worsening the condition of your eczema.\\n2. “Eczema” is a broad term which covers many different specific (but related) skin conditions. Eczema is also known as atopic dermatitis. The physical symptoms of all types of eczema tend to be dry, reddened, itchy skin, which makes the diagnosis difficult. Some types of eczema are caused by allergies, immune disorders, or excessive washing of the facial skin. It’s helpful to track your eczema symptoms and note what causes the eczema to break out. Try keeping a daily journal in which you record foods you’ve eaten, personal skincare routines, and any environmental factors that seem to have an effect on your eczema. Visit your doctor, and describe your eczema symptoms, including how long the rash has been present, and if any specific causes make the eczema worse. Eczema runs in families and is associated with asthma, allergies, and elevated immunoglobulin in the blood.\\n3. You can apply a moisturizing facial lotion whether or not you’ve just taken a shower. If you’re concerned that you’ll forget the lotion, try setting a timer or writing down a lotion schedule on a notepad. Apply lotion as often as possible, perhaps on an hourly (or even half-hourly) schedule. If you’re not sure which lotions are most effective, ask your doctor. Brands like Cetaphil, Eucerin, and Aveeno tend to work well. Look for lotions that contain petroleum jelly and mineral oil, and shy away from lotions with added fragrances.\\n4. v4-460px-Treat-Face-Eczema-Step-6.jpg\\n5. Although it can sometimes be very itchy, you should never scratch your patches of eczema. Doing so can further irritate the already-irritated skin, causing the eczema to worsen.

The tulip plant has attractive green leaves that look great throughout the summer.\\n2. v4-460px-Prune-Tulips-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n3. Once your tulips blossom and the flowers start to fade, the flowers become wilted and look unattractive. Typically, tulips begin to fade in May or June.

Traditionally, married couples are presented as a pair under the husband’s name, as in “Mr. and Mrs. Edward Jennings.” These days, it’s also acceptable to use both the husband and wife’s names, as in “Edward and Silvia Jennings.”\\nYou might also be able to get away with using the couple’s last name alone if it’s a smaller wedding and there are no other couples with the same surname in attendance. Married couples should always be listed together on the same card.\\n2. v4-460px-Address-Guests-on-Escort-Cards-Step-4.jpg\\n3. It’s common for family groups to be addressed collectively. The only exceptions are especially large families and occasions when 1 or more members will be accompanied by their own families, such as a husband and wife arriving independently of 1 spouse’s parents and younger siblings. A card reading “The Gutierrez Family” can account for any number of related guests who have RSVPd to confirm their attendance. Putting whole families down on the same escort card saves you the trouble (and extra materials) of making cards for each person individually.\\n4. v4-460px-Address-Guests-on-Escort-Cards-Step-6.jpg\\n5. Guests who are planning on showing up by themselves need only be identified by their first and last name. Consider including the person’s middle initial if they have a common name that may be shared with other guests. Unless your wedding is going to be an informal celebration, don’t use abbreviations or nicknames—write “Samantha” instead of “Sam” and “William” rather than “Bill.”\\nAn escort card for an unaccompanied guest might simply read: “John B.

After about 1-2 years of growth, your walnut tree should have its basic form. It should have several moderately thick branches and be roughly 4–6 ft (1.2–1.8 m) tall. At this point, you can begin shaping the tree into the central leader position. The central leader position typically has 1 main trunk with about 5 branches on the side. The central leader position is based off the natural growth of the tree, focusing on a main leader branch that keeps the canopy of the tree open to light and air circulation. The central leader helps supply nutrients to the large, fruit bearing branches so the tree grows as many walnuts as possible.\\n1. When pruning walnut trees, observe the \"3-to-1 rule.\" Examine the thickness of your trunk, and use this as a guide when deciding which branches to keep and which to remove. If you find a branch larger than ⅓ of the trunk\\'s diameter, cut it off at a 45-degree angle. This way, your branches will all receive a balanced amount of nutrients and grow healthy and strong. If your tree has more than 1 thick branch, then it will be harder for the other branches to grow and develop walnuts. If you keep branches that are on the thicker side, they can unevenly drain the nutrients from the tree and grow too thick.\\n2. Inspect the framework of your tree, and look for any branches that have intersecting paths or touch together. These branches are cosmetically unattractive, and they often make the inner skeleton of your tree bulky and hard to access. As a result, your tree may not grow as many walnuts. To prevent this, cut off these branches where they meet the trunk of the tree. This way, your tree only grows outward-facing, healthy branches. This keeps the tree invigorated, so it can put more energy into fewer branches.\\n3. v4-460px-Prune-Walnut-Trees-Step-04.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Prune-Walnut-Trees-Step-02.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Prune-Walnut-Trees-Step-06.jpg', 'question_id': 10064126, 'answer_choices': [[0, 4, 1, 3, 2, 5], [0, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5], [0, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5], [0, 2, 4, 5, 1, 3]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10064188.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Contact-George-W.-Bush-Step-2.jpg\\n1.

Generally, you'll file your petition for legal separation in the county where the defendant lives.

While a little bit of self-deprecating humor can be charming, avoid criticizing yourself or the other person while you chat. Take this time to express your positive qualities. For example, don’t say something like, “I know you’re probably not interested in me, but can I have your number?” This can set the wrong tone for the conversation. If you want their number, simply say, “It was great talking to you. Would you mind if I asked for your number?”\\nAvoid being complaining too much as you talk. For example, if someone asks you about your job, don’t say, “I hate it there so much. My boss is such a jerk.” Try to be more neutral. For example, you can say, “I work at the store. It pays the bills.”\\n5. If the other person is interested in talking, they will continue the conversation with you. They may ask a question or share a story. This is a sign that you can continue the conversation. If they respond with a 1-word answer like “cool” or “yeah,” they may not be interested in talking. That’s okay. Step back and try again with someone else.\\n6. v4-460px-Flirt-when-You-Have-Social-Anxiety-Step-2.jpg\\n7. v4-460px-Flirt-when-You-Have-Social-Anxiety-Step-4.jpg\", 'question_id': 10066824, 'answer_choices': [[1, 4, 0, 5, 7, 2, 6, 3], [4, 7, 0, 5, 6, 1, 3, 2], [4, 3, 1, 0, 2, 7, 6, 5], [0, 6, 5, 7, 2, 1, 4, 3]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10066866.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Store-a-Lawn-Mower-Step-2.jpg\\n1. Doing this will prevent the mower from unnecessarily draining power from the battery while in storage. Upon removal, clean the battery with a cloth, and store it in a cool, dry place. To lower the risk of an accidental fire, always keep the mower's battery away from fuel, sources of heat, and anything that has a pilot light.\\n2. Condensation inside the fuel tank can seriously damage the mower's engine: if moisture develops, it can cause corrosion, clogs, and other problems. Having an empty tank before your mower is put into storage lowers the risk of condensation forming. Start up your mower, and let it run until it no longer starts back up, and the fuel lines are empty. Keeping fuel inside the mower is also a fire hazard.

Instead of choosing just 1 shoot, pick 5 to 6 of the strongest-looking ones, and remove the rest. These will turn into branches growing directly from the ground without any trunk. You will be cutting them shorter eventually. A multi-trunked plant is more likely to survive a freeze; if 1 of these branches dies, you can simply replace it with another sucker. You should use a pair of pruning shears for this as well, unless the shoots are too thick. In this case, use the fine-toothed saw.\\n3. Suckers are additional shoots growing from the ground. Water sprouts are shoots growing from the base of the trunk, below the main branches. Not only can they detract from the overall appearance of the tree, but they can also suck up nutrients and water. You will need to do this every summer afterwards. Cut suckers as close to the root as possible with pruning shears; you may have to dig through the soil in order to reach the base. Use pruning shears to snip the water sprouts off as close to the trunk as possible.\\n4. v4-460px-Prune-Pomegranate-Trees-Step-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10067130, 'answer_choices': [[4, 0, 1, 3, 2], [1, 0, 4, 2, 3], [1, 4, 2, 0, 3], [2, 0, 3, 4, 1]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10067203.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. If you notice any damaged or decaying areas on your plants due to frostbite or other problems, it is best to remove them while pruning in the spring. To do this, line your pruning shears up to the stem at the start of the discoloration, and make a clean snip at a 45-degree angle. You can cut the damaged stems down to the ground or leave them between ⁄2–1 ft (0.15–0.30 m), based on your personal preference. If you want a shorter shrub, chop it to the ground. This way, your plant will not waste any valuable nutrients on withered stems.\\n1. Typically, lantana plants bloom through the spring and fall. Trim your plant in the late winter or early spring before it hits the growth period for optimal flower yield.

Make sure your tools are sharpened before you use them. Sanitize your tools with rubbing alcohol before and after you cut each plant. This helps prevent the spread of bacteria and disease.

In most cases, a sharp pair of household scissors should work for pruning fuchsias. Just make sure to sanitize them first.\\n1. Snip the branch at the base of the plant or where the wood is healthy. Leave darker colored wood and cut away pale or faded wood. If a branch is broken, make your cut just below the break. Cuts made at an angle will help water run off the stem and prevent any fungal diseases.

The sap of the rubber plant is sticky, and will start to flow from the cuts you make when pruning the branches. To prevent the sticky sap from getting onto your fingers, wear a pair of gloves while pruning. Canvas work gloves would suffice, as would rubber dishwashing gloves.\\n3. As with any indoor plant, remove any leaves and branches from your rubber plant that appear to be dead or dying. This will improve the overall appearance of the rubber plant, and keep the plant in good health. You can remove dead leaves in any season using your fingers.

Keeping your plant free from dead leaves can also promote new growth on the stem (you might even notice some when you pull off the dead leaves).', 'question_id': 10068486, 'answer_choices': [[0, 2, 1], [2, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 0]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10068752.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Prune-Strawberries-Step-4.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Prune-Strawberries-Step-2.jpg\\n2.

Berms can act as miniature dams, altering the water flow in your garden. You may need to dig swales between the berms, build a culvert running through the berm, or regrade your garden. You may want to discuss this with a professional landscaper if you are building a tall berm (especially above 24 inches / 61 cm), or if you live in a rainy climate. A flat top reduces runoff and provides more water to plants growing on the side of the berm. While building your berm, do your best to avoid compacting the soil at the base with heavy equipment. If it's already compacted, loosen the soil by digging 8 inches (20 cm) deep to improve drainage.\\n1. Roll an empty lawn roller over the top layer of soil, or tamp it down with your feet or a board.

With a shovel or bobcat, pile on fill dirt, compacting it periodically. Shape it according to the layout you decided on, except 1 ft (30 cm) smaller on all sides. Rake it smooth and get all proportions as exact as possible. Well-compacted clay soil is recommended for steep or tall berms. Loam will typically collapse at slopes steeper than 35%. Gravel is cheaper, but the soil tends to wash through it — and it is not compliant with some local codes.

If your plant is extremely overgrown or not looking healthy, you can revitalize it by pruning it to the ground. Use pruning shears or a hedge clipper to cut off the stems of the plant as close to the ground as you can. This sends the plant into dormancy through the colder season. As it starts to get warm, the plant grows new, healthy stems. This is a good idea if your kangaroo paw has overgrown your garden bed or if the plant looks withered and sickly. If your kangaroo paws are in a pot rather than your garden, it is healthier for the plant to leave a few healthy stems if you can. That way, it can grow back faster.\\n2. v4-460px-Prune-Kangaroo-Paws-Step-2.jpg\\n3. Typically, the best time to do this is at the end of summer or in early autumn, based on when your plant stops flowering. Use pruning shears or loppers to remove about one third of your plant's total mass. This encourages the plant to grow new buds, so it can bloom beautifully the following season. Make your cuts at a 45-degree angle to minimally damage the plant. If your plant is very small or does not grow quickly, it only requires a light pruning. You can snip around one fourth of the plant off rather than one third.\\n4. If the middle of your kangaroo paw is very dense and congested, snip off some of the leaves using your pruning shears.

Check each of your plants or seedlings thoroughly before purchasing them. Look for an orchid with flowers that are partially open and some flowers that have yet to open. If all of the flowers have opened already, then it will be difficult to evaluate the health of the plant. Inspect the petals for fungal spots and pests, which would indicate that the plant is not healthy. The grower’s shop is also a good indication of a plant’s health.

You can tell when the heads are mature by their visual appearance: they’ll have a dark green color and look leafy and open. Unlike iceberg lettuce, the romaine heads will not be densely closed in upon themselves when mature.\\n3. In order to leave the garden patch relatively undisturbed, and to avoid bringing dirt indoors, remove excess dirt from the romaine’s roots. You can do this with either hand while you’re pulling the lettuce head up from the ground. Once the lettuce is uprooted, pat the dirt back in place so there isn’t a hole left in the garden patch. You can also dig around in the soil a bit to remove any leftover roots that may be stuck in the soil.

In the fall before temperatures drop and the first frost forms, prune your plant back to the lowest point of new growth. New growth should still be green on the outside and inside. This will require you to harvest any remaining fruit. Then, use pruning shears to make cuts to all the growth on your plant above about 2 inches (5.1 cm). Even a light frost will kill eggplant. Even though eggplants are perennials, they are typically grown as annuals. Leaving them in the garden over the winter may cause them to have a lower yield over the course of a few years. Keeping eggplants as perennials works best in temperate to warm climates since the plants require warm soil to grow.

A few simple tricks can make you a great employee and help you leave a great impression on your supervisors and co-workers. Always come in on time and never complain about the work you’re assigned to do. Stay on-task at work and be polite to everyone around you. Not only will you show your supervisor that you’re a good employee and deserve a good reference—you’ll also make your workplace a more pleasant place to be.\\n1. No matter what job you have, being a good employee can only serve you well in the future. Working hard to do your job right and impress your boss can open lots of doors for you: you’ll secure a great reference for future jobs and make valuable connections. Do your tasks without complaint and keep an upbeat attitude. Show your supervisor that you want to be there, even if it’s not your dream job. This is especially important if your job is at a company or in a field where you’d like to work in the future.\\n2. v4-460px-Make-the-Most-of-Your-Summer-Job-Step-6.jpg\\n3. Take on an “always say yes” attitude. Accept any project you’re offered and smaller things that no one else wants to do, and complete them as quickly and effectively as you can. Impress your supervisors by turning little tasks into bigger projects that you can knock out of the park. For example, if your boss asks you to organize shirts on a display, use it as a chance to showcase your creativity. If they ask you to do research for a presentation, make sure its organized, easy to read, and gives even more information than they asked for. Go above and beyond by taking on projects outside of your job duties, as well as getting in early and staying later. This tells supervisors that you’re dedicated and willing to work hard to do a good job. Suggest or volunteer for projects that speak to your interests or would look good on your resume, especially if you’re not in your preferred industry. For example, if you’re working in retail but want to do marketing, ask if you can create window displays to work on your design skills.\\n4. v4-460px-Make-the-Most-of-Your-Summer-Job-Step-2.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Make-the-Most-of-Your-Summer-Job-Step-4.jpg', 'question_id': 10070395, 'answer_choices': [[0, 4, 2, 5, 1, 3], [1, 4, 3, 5, 0, 2], [5, 0, 2, 3, 4, 1], [0, 5, 2, 3, 1, 4]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10070912.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Test-Peripheral-Vision-Step-02.jpg\\n1.

Formal notation is the way musicians describe the objective details of music accurately to their fellow players. It takes years to develop a masterful understanding of notation, but having a general idea as to the tools musicians use to communicate with one another will help out a lot. The \\'key\\' of a song refers to the chords and set of notes it predominantly uses. A \\'minor key\\', for instance, tends to sound inherently sad, while a \\'major key\\' is often uplifting. Tempo refers to the speed of the music or the pace of the beat.\\n1. v4-460px-Become-a-College-Professor-Step-13.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Transpose-Music-from-C-to-F-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\\n3. Genres categorize music within overarching umbrellas; large amounts of music tied together via a common tone or structural approach, but usually both. Referring to genre is the easiest way you can describe music to someone. Genres may refer primarily to the sound, but they come with a lot of preconceptions, including lyrical content and artistic intention. If the song you\\'re trying to describe fits what you know of the genre, the genre-tag will become that much more useful to you. In modern music, it is common for musical groups to draw from two or more genres to develop a unique character of their own. Calling a band \\'eclectic\\' is a decent start if they\\'re playing in many different genres. Try to keep your genre tags limited to one or two however; anything more and you\\'ll just end up confusing whomever you\\'re talking to. The Beatles, for instance, incorporate many styles, but they\\'re best seen as pop. Led Zeppelin could be considered anything from progressive to blues or metal, but they\\'re arguably best pegged as bluesy hard rock. For example, you might say: \"Deathspell Omega\\'s \"Obombration\" is an interesting song for the band.

You want to cut back your grass once a year, as late in the season as possible. For warm season grasses, you want to trim them between late fall and mid-spring. For cool season grasses, cut them back in early spring. Cutting your grass in the wrong season can impact its ability to grow and pollinate. Your grass should be brown before you start cutting it back. Ideally, you should wait until at least mid-winter or early spring to cut it back. Some insect species will spend the winter in bunch grasses. Wait until the spring to cut the previous season’s growth to protect wildlife. Examples of warm-season grasses include Japanese forest grass, Japanese silver grass, switchgrass, fountain grass, maiden grass, and prairie cordgrass.

To prune large plants, start by snipping the spent flowers or gently pulling them off by hand. Focus on flowers that show signs of damage or are beginning to lose their color. Leave healthy blooms intact. Mature rosemary shrubs put out delicate blue, pink, purple, or white blossoms which give them aesthetic as well as culinary value. Rosemary flowers are actually edible, so consider saving a few of the blooms that appear to be in better shape.\\n2. Use a pair of sharp pruning shears to clip the stems at a slight angle. Cleaning up the most developed offshoots stimulates new growth—sometimes, a single stem may even branch off into 2 separate stems when it grows back. Avoid cutting below the lower leaves. Removing too much greenery can inadvertently harm the foliage, causing the plant to grow only bare woody branches. Container-raised rosemary growing indoors should be pruned the same way.

The best time to prune rosemary is between March and June, when the warm weather and plentiful sunshine will help produce healthy new foliage. However, you can also begin as early as the last weeks of winter, or hold off until things start cooling off in the fall. A good rule of thumb is to schedule your last trim of the season no later than 4-6 weeks before the earliest expected frost. This will give the new growth a chance to harden off before the temperature outside plummets. Get in the habit of pruning your rosemary around the same time every year. Regular attention will allow it to flourish.\\n4. v4-460px-Prune-Rosemary-Step-4.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Prune-Rosemary-Step-6.jpg', 'question_id': 10073648, 'answer_choices': [[5, 1, 3, 0, 4, 2], [3, 0, 1, 4, 2, 5], [0, 4, 2, 5, 3, 1], [5, 1, 4, 2, 0, 3]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10073698.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Wear-a-Parka-Step-4.jpg\\n1. If you want a sturdy winter coat to last you throughout many seasons, choose a heavy-duty parka made from insulating materials. For a very warm jacket, choose one with 150-200g of insulation. For the warmest option possible, get a full-length parka. This coat runs to your shins, so it can keep you warm nearly from head to toe. Many parkas are lined with sherpa materials, goose feathers, or synthetic fillers that keep you toasty!

Get out a hard, flat surface, such as a wooden cutting board. Heat one side of your soap with your heat gun, then rub that side against the flat surface. Repeat this step for each side of the soap.

Place the soap close enough to the heat sealer so that it bumps against the edges of the outer frame. This will bring the blades as close as possible to the soap. There will be small gaps between the edges of the soap and the seams on the bag. This is perfectly fine.

When you apologize to your girlfriend, it’s important for her to see how much of an impact she’s had on your life. Tell her how amazing she is and how you’re a fool for putting your relationship into question; remind her of some of the best things you love about her, and let her see that you’re really upset that you hurt her. While you don’t want to sound too much like you’re sucking up, you should make it clear that you really care for her and don’t want to lose her. Be specific. Don’t just tell her she’s the most amazing girl ever; refer to specific qualities that show you’re really paying attention to her. You don’t have to put on an act. If you really do care for her, then it should be pretty obvious to her as soon as you start apologizing.\\n1. If there are specific steps you need to take to not do what you did again, then you should tell her exactly what you have planned so she knows you’re serious about not being a repeat offender.

She’ll be touched that you tried as hard as you did if you show her that you really do want to improve and won’t go back to your old ways. You can say something like, “I’m so sorry I called you names. The next time I get so worked up, I’m going to step outside and take a breather or give myself a few minutes to speak. I’ll make sure I’ll think before I speak next time so I don’t end up saying something I don’t mean again.

If you want to get your girlfriend to forgive you, then the first thing you have to do is to give her the most sincere apology you’re capable of giving. This means you have to suck it up and see her in person instead of sending her a lame text. Make sure you pick a place where you can get some privacy and a time when she is ready to hear you out; if she’s too angry to talk to you, then respect her and give her some space until she wants to talk. When you talk to her, make eye contact, put your phone away, and don’t look around. Let her see that you’ve gotten rid of all of your distractions and that her happiness is a priority for you. Keep it short and simple. You don’t need to go into a huge, elaborate explanation of why you did what you did unless you feel that it’s really necessary. What’s most important is that you make it clear how sorry you are. Say something like, “I am so sorry about what I did to you. I can’t tell you how much I regret it and how much I wish I hadn’t hurt you. You mean so much to me and I feel like such an idiot for putting all of that in jeopardy.”\\n6. If you want your girlfriend to really forgive you, then you should be honest with her about what happened. You don’t want to tell her a partial truth and have her find out the rest later, unless you want her to be even more angry with you. If you cheated on her, you don’t have to give her every little detail, but you shouldn’t try to downplay what you did too much, either. If you ever want your girlfriend to really trust you again, then honesty is the best policy. She won’t forgive you if you’re holding back or clearly lying to her still. She’ll only get more angry and will feel even more hurt and upset with you.

When you move a fern, it may need some help getting settled in its new location. Cut back all the fronds by half, reducing the water your fern needs to support itself. This technique lets the plant focus more attention on getting its roots settled. Don't worry. Once the plant is settled, it will grow back.\\n3. v4-460px-Prune-Ferns-Step-4.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Prune-Ferns-Step-2.jpg\\n5. Some ferns, such as the Giant Chain Fern, do not do well with spring pruning. It's best to let the old foliage die out by itself in mid-summer. If you don't, you can cause damage to the plant.

This is another important point to get before you get yourself mixed up with people you disagree with, especially if they are close-minded. You may think that reason or sheer facts will win out every time, and that the other person will walk away thinking, \"Wow, I never thought of it that way...\" after you\\'ve given him or her a double-dose of your logic. However, this is not always going to happen, and you may get frustrated over this. If you realize that, while you may have very valid and reasonable opinions, you won\\'t be able to convince the person of your point of view very easily, then you will stop trying. And if you stop trying to make the other person see your point, then you will be much less likely to get frustrated. Remember that your goal is not to make the close-minded person agree with you; it\\'s to make yourself stay calm and sane while dealing with him or her.\\n2. v4-460px-Deal-With-Dumb-People-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\\n3. This one is tough, but very important. Part of the reason that you may find yourself constantly frustrated by the stupidity in the world is because you have unrealistic expectations. Different people may have different backgrounds, different opinions or different priorities in their life. Remind yourself that the \"average\" person isn\\'t going to meet your high expectations of how a person should think and act, and lower your standards accordingly. If you don\\'t expect people to be sharp, respectful people, then you\\'ll be pleasantly surprised when they are -- instead of being constantly disappointed when they don\\'t meet your expectations.\\n4. Both genetics and opportunities can make a difference to overall \"smarts.\" One of the reasons some people appear smarter than others may be that they came from a hard working environment, got good marks in school, and that they started many things from scratch and/or have been  stuck having to take care of family members, working a part-time job in high school, or taking on other responsibilities that kept them from spending so much time becoming a smarty pants. On the other side we can see the people who don\\'t appear so smart, they had difficulties to understand things so quick, even when they were kids, they never cared about education and getting good marks at school. When a stupid person frustrates you, just ask yourself if he had all of the best opportunities -- chances are, you\\'ll see that this is not the case, would he use it the same you did. If he did he will not be considered as non smart person. Intelligence is not determined by family or wealth or love. However, development of skills and knowledge can be influenced by one\\'s life experiences and opportunities. Reminding yourself to take each person on a case-by-case basis will make you less frustrated, because you\\'ll stop constantly asking yourself why this person isn\\'t acting just like you are.\\n5. v4-460px-Deal-With-Dumb-People-Step-5-Version-3.jpg', 'question_id': 1007715, 'answer_choices': [[3, 5, 4, 2, 1, 0], [4, 3, 5, 0, 2, 1], [5, 4, 1, 2, 0, 3], [5, 3, 2, 0, 4, 1]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10077219.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-459px-Clean-Espadrilles-Step-4.jpg\\n1. v4-459px-Clean-Espadrilles-Step-2.jpg\\n2.

For example, your doctor might ask, “How well are you sleeping at night?” Sleeplessness and sleepiness are both potential side effects of Zoloft. Also, talk with your doctor about your specific health goals. What are you hoping that increasing your Zoloft dosage will help you to accomplish? For example, tell your doctor if you’d like to feel happier or less stressed out.\\n4. Once you and your doctor have decided that you need more Zoloft, it’s important to boost your dosage in a controlled, safe way. Since you are already taking Zoloft, it will usually only take a week for your body to react to more medication. Be candid when discussing with your doctor how you feel from week to week. In general, the maximum dosage increase that you will get per week is 50 mg/day.

If the shooter were to hit the top rim of the glass and miss the shot, the other players may call for a challenge (challenging the shooter to get it in). If the shooter misses again, he or she must take a drink for each challenging player, but if the shooter gets it in the glass all challengers must drink. However, the shooter does not have to accept the initial challenge, and can instead choose to pass the coin on to the next shooter.\\n2. You will need one standard cup (milk glass will do), some alcohol, cups to put the alcohol in, a table, and a quarter. Players (as many as you would like) sit around the table, either standing or in chairs. The milk glass is placed in the center of the table, at least 10 inches away from each player. Each person gets their own cup, filled with the alcohol of their choosing. Beer is usually used rather than hard liquor.\\n3. v4-460px-Play-Quarters-Step-6-Version-3.jpg\\n4. After a miss, the shooter passes the quarter to the next player. Sometimes, after a miss, the shooter can opt to play \"chance\", which gives them another attempt. All that is required of this is for the shooter to say the word \"chance\" after a miss. A successful \"chance\" shot means the shooter can continue shooting normally, but a miss results in a penalty drink.\\n5. v4-460px-Play-Quarters-Step-2-Version-3.jpg', 'question_id': 10079, 'answer_choices': [[3, 5, 1, 0, 4, 2], [5, 0, 1, 4, 3, 2], [1, 0, 3, 2, 5, 4], [2, 5, 4, 0, 1, 3]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10080311.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Harvest-Macadamia-Nuts-Step-2.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Harvest-Macadamia-Nuts-Step-4.jpg\\n2. During harvesting season—late fall (Autumn) to spring—focus your efforts on periods when weather is wet. When the weather is dry, collect your nuts less often—every 1 to 2 months. Wet weather is more likely to cause mold, germination, and rat or pig damage. Always make it a top priority to get your nuts inside during this weather. Healthy macadamia trees begin bearing nuts after 6 to 7 years. They will produce around 30 to 50 pounds (14 to 23 kg) of nuts by 10 years of age. This amount gradually increases as your tree ages from this time.\\n3. Look out for spots on leaves, twig dieback, and bronzed or yellow leaves. The most common diseases in macadamia trees are macadamia root rot (Kretzschmaria clavis), trunk canker (Phytophthora cinnamomi), and macadamia quick decline (MQD). The first two can be caused by prolonged drought and poor drainage, while the third is typically caused by stresses such as low pH and nutritional problems. Prune your trees in the spring and remove diseased and dying branches from their canopy. Remove remaining nuts on the trees after pruning. Apply mulch after harvesting your nuts, and avoid piling it against the tree's trunk—this can cause disease. While these diseases don’t always affect macadamias, throw out any nuts that show signs of rot or damage and prune damaged regions of your trees.\", 'question_id': 10080311, 'answer_choices': [[1, 2, 0, 3], [2, 1, 3, 0], [2, 0, 3, 1], [2, 0, 3, 1]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10080722.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Many people plant the three sisters because they grow well organically. To keep up with this practice, prepare the soil by applying an organic high-nitrogen fertilizer around the mound. You can use manure, fish emulsion, or—for a very traditional approach—fish scraps. If you decide that you don’t want an organic garden, you can use a basic 10-10-10 fertilizer.\\n1. The three sisters need plenty of space to grow to their fullest potential. Ideally, the plot should be at least 10 by 10 feet (3.0 m × 3.0 m) large. The plot should not be near any tree, sheds, walls, or other shaded areas.\\n2. Heirloom varieties are more traditional, and they grow well together. Non-heirloom varieties of beans, in particular, may grow too large and overwhelm the other plants if used. Choose flint, dent, or flour corn varieties. While you can plant sweet corn, you will have to harvest it much earlier than the other plants. Choose pole or runner beans instead of bush beans. Dry beans, such as pinto or kidney beans, or green beans work well. Pumpkin or squash works well in this configuration.

As people live longer, more are spending their later years in nursing homes. Because of the high costs of nursing care, their assets quickly become depleted and the state must pay for the care using Medicaid. When you die, the state will come after some assets to cover any unpaid medical bills. For example, Joannie enters a nursing home at age 80 with Alzheimer’s and lives for three more years. Because her family can’t pay, the state steps in and pays the $160,000 in nursing home care. Joannie’s only asset is her home, which she leaves to her children in a will. However, the state will seize the home to cover the costs of Joannie’s care. You might be able to avoid the state taking the asset if you transfer it well in advance, e.g., five years before you need care. This is a very complicated decision you should talk about with a lawyer.\\n3. You can leave your home to a beneficiary using your will or trust. However, it’s also possible to leave your home to someone using other methods. You should consider which is preferable:\\nLife estate deed. You deed the property to someone but keep a life estate for yourself. The life estate lets you use and occupy the home during your lifetime. At death, it passes to the other owner. Transfer on death deed. Some states have this option. When you die, the house passes to the person named on the deed without having to go through probate. You can revoke the deed at any time.

Flights from foreign countries can be more expensive due to fees from the Indian government for landing at the airport.\\n1. v4-460px-Go-to-the-Andaman-and-Nicobar-Islands-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Go-to-the-Andaman-and-Nicobar-Islands-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n3. In order to book your travel, you will need to have a valid passport and visa to travel to India if you are entering from a foreign country. In most cases, travelers are required to have a passport that is valid for 6 months after their date of arrival. To apply online for a travel visa to enter India, visit https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/evisa/tvoa.html# and follow the prompts. Remember to pay the fee for your visa, which can vary depending on the duration and type of visa.\\n4. Once you're on the island, you can visit other areas of the island via ferries or helicopters, which depart from the Phoenix Bay Jetty and Port Blair. Ferry rides between islands can take an hour or more, depending on how far away they are. Helicopters depart every 20-45 minutes to a variety of destinations. Check the ferry times posted in the Daily Telegram or by calling the Directorate of Shipping Services at +91-3192-231794. Helicopter tickets can cost between 1000-4000 Rupees, depending on the destination.\", 'question_id': 10084503, 'answer_choices': [[4, 3, 0, 2, 1], [1, 2, 4, 3, 0], [4, 0, 2, 1, 3], [0, 2, 3, 1, 4]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10084564.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Call-Colombia-from-the-US-Step-4.jpg\\n1. The person you are calling in Colombia will be using a mobile area code instead of a landline area code. The person you are calling should be able to give you this number, but if they don’t know you should be able to figure it out based on their mobile network provider. You can find the mobile network code online if your contact doesn’t know it. The mobile code is 3 digits long. Keep in mind that it needs to come after the exit code and country code, so the numbers will read as follows: 011-57-315-xxx-xxxx.\\n2.

In Texas Hold’em the dealer and/or the button-position will be passed to the next player toward the left after each hand. But, if one person deals all the time, then the button-position will rotate the table over time, otherwise the dealer job passes around. Understanding where you are in relation to the dealer/button will help you develop a strategy to win Texas Hold’em. The button has the strongest position because he/she will always wait to bet last on the current hand. The player who bets last will have the most information to work with as they’ve seen all other players bets/actions before making a move. But, the player immediately to the right of the dealer, sometimes known as the “cutoff,” can potentially be in a strong position over the button as he has the ability to bet big enough to force the button into action/to bet-big or fold. Players in early betting positions are the weakest as they have the least amount of information to go on. However, there is a bit of a balancing out for the first round if you are either the big or small blind, as you have a bet already on the table.\\n3. If you are in an earlier position you do have the benefit of being able to call the minimum and then waiting to see how other players handle the betting around the table. If a player bets big after you’ve called, you now know that he is either bluffing, or has a good hand. Chances are other players will make moves that indicate where the competition is going. When you are later to act in a round of betting you are at a great advantage. This is helpful against predictable/tight players who you expect to \"tell\" you a lot by always checking weak hands and raising better hands. You can play marginal hands by betting when they check before you act.

Start in the early morning when there is more moisture in the stalks since this will prevent breakage.

It takes around 2 months for barley to grow large enough to harvest and have the largest yield of grains. When the stalks turn completely yellow, the moisture levels in the barley are lower and they are easier to cut down. Spring barley grown in the Northern Hemisphere is typically harvested in July or August while winter barley is harvested in the April or May.

Cauliflower is a cold-weather crop, but you may be able to grow it in your spring garden if you live in an area where the temperature remains under 85 °F (29 °C) during the spring and summer. If you planted your cauliflower in late April or May, you can harvest it in late August or early September.\\n2. v4-460px-Harvest-Cauliflower-Step-4.jpg\\n3. Healthy cauliflower grows 1 large head in the center of the plant. When the head of your cauliflower is compact and sizable, it is are ready for harvest. Avoid harvesting them too early before the head is completely white. Also, avoid waiting to harvest until the head of the cauliflower spreads out. Your cauliflower will taste bitter and tough if you harvest them before or after they are ready. If you see a flower emerging from the plant, you’ve waited too long to harvest. Cauliflower requires consistent temperatures around 60 °F (16 °C). If the temperatures are warm, the plant will form small \"button\" heads rather than a large white head.\\n4. The head of the cauliflower plant grows directly in the center, and many large, dark leaves grow around the head. After you cut off the head, you should remove the leaves as well. Rip the leaves off with your fingers, or use garden shears to snip them off where they meet the stem. This helps the plant continue to grow new cauliflower. You can sauté the leaves as a hearty side or look for cauliflower leaf recipes, for instance. Cook them as you would any other type of greens.

Inspect the interior of the shrub for offshoots that overlap or wind around each other. Clip off the more crooked of the 2 branches at its base—it’s not necessary to remove them both. Don’t forget to check for tangled or twisted stems near the outer part of the plant, as well. In addition to making your shrubs look better, getting rid of criss-crossing branches will also open them up in the middle, proving airflow essential for keeping pests and diseases at bay.\\n1. v4-460px-Prune-Rose-of-Sharon-Step-4.jpg\\n2. Generally speaking, Rose of Sharon is an exceptionally self-sufficient plant, and doesn’t require much upkeep. If you decide that your shrubs are in need of touching up, however, do it during the colder months while they’re still in their dormant stage. Doing so will help stimulate new growth once the weather warms up. As a rule, the best time to prune your Rose of Sharon is anywhere from March to early May, before the blooms begin to open. Cutting back your Rose of Sharon too early or too late can “shock” the plant, leaving it vulnerable to the elements and stunting healthy new growth.\\n3. If your Rose of Sharon isn’t faring well (or it’s grown to colossal proportions), it’s okay to remove quite a bit more growth than you leave. As long as the hardy living wood at the base of the plant is intact, it will return to produce eye-catching blooms year after year. The practice of significantly reducing a plant\\'s overall size is referred to as \"hard\" or \"rejuvenation\" pruning. Hard pruning is useful for promoting healthy new growth in old or failing plants. It’s safe to prune Rose of Sharon down to bare stubs that are only 2–3 feet (0.61–0.91 m) in length while it’s still dormancy. Keep in mind that the more branches you cut, the fewer flowers there will be when the shrub finally blooms. However, the flowers that are there will be much bolder and more vibrant since the plant will be able to devote more of its resources to the remaining growth.\\n4. v4-460px-Prune-Rose-of-Sharon-Step-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10084922, 'answer_choices': [[4, 1, 3, 2, 0], [3, 0, 1, 2, 4], [2, 1, 4, 0, 3], [2, 4, 0, 1, 3]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10085027.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. When you can, try to keep your jaw in a relaxed position by opening your mouth just enough so that your teeth don’t touch. This can relieve some of the pressure on the jaw that commonly causes clicking. If you notice yourself clenching your jaw or grinding your teeth, open your mouth slightly to stop creating excess pressure. If you wake up with pain in your jaw or teeth, then you may grind your teeth at night. Talk to your doctor about getting a mouth guard that you can wear while you sleep. You can also buy a mouth guard over-the-counter, which can be shaped to your mouth.\\n1. Clicking can be made worse when your jaw is inflamed. Taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as naproxen or ibuprofen can help control pain and swelling, which in turn can reduce jaw clicking.

If you buy a Java fern at a pet shop or even order it online, it will often come pre-attached to a small piece of driftwood. In this case, you can simply place the fern and driftwood into your aquarium as-is, since Java ferns grow best when attached to driftwood or stone. Often, the fern will be attached to the wood with a thin thread that should dissolve over time in the water. The root system of the Java fern will hold it in place.\\n1. The Java fern has a simple plant structure: the long, thin leaves and the stringy, numerous roots sprout out from a dense rhizome. Wrap thread or fishing line around the rhizome and the attaching object (e.g., rock or driftwood) several times, or use a zip tie or two to secure them together. After you attach the rhizome to a rock or piece of wood, the roots will eventually secure the fern to the object with a strong bond.

Add about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of soil amendment material and work it into the soil evenly.\\n2. v4-460px-Grow-Endive-Step-2.jpg\\n3. Endive plants thrive in full sunlight but they can also tolerate partial shade, especially in warmer climates. They will, however, struggle if planted in a spot with full shade. Choose a spot in your garden free of obstructions that may block out light. In general, \"full sun\" refers to 6-8 hours of sunlight per day, while \"partial shade\" refers to 4-6 hours of sunlight per day.', 'question_id': 10086621, 'answer_choices': [[2, 1, 0, 3], [3, 2, 1, 0], [3, 0, 2, 1], [2, 3, 1, 0]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10086833.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Harvest-Beeswax-Step-6.jpg\\n1. The honeycomb is attached to the frame with beeswax. To get the wax cappings, scrape an uncapping knife down the frame from top to bottom in one steady motion. The honeycomb should easily slide off the frame with moderate pressure. After you’ve removed the wax cappings from the frame, place the fame back into its slot in the hive. To heat up your knife, place it in boiling water for 30-60 seconds. A capping knife is a long, straight knife used to harvest honey and beeswax. If you don’t have a capping knife, you can use a dull butter knife or a fork.\\n2. v4-460px-Harvest-Beeswax-Step-4.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Harvest-Beeswax-Step-2.jpg\\n4. It is best to harvest your beeswax when there are as little bees around the hive as possible. Typically, bees leave in the morning to search for pollen and return to the hive at the end of the day. This way, you are less likely to get stung! Having fewer bees around makes it easier to access the frames and get the wax caps, as well. Bees can get in your way and make the process more difficult.\\n5. If you wait too long to render the wax caps, it will be difficult to pull them out of the honey. For best results, pick the wax caps out of the bucket as the honey drains to the bottom. Place the wax caps in a small bowl so you can render the beeswax. If you are preparing your beeswax outside, waiting awhile may encourage bees to come find you and the honey.\\n6. A smoker makes the bees move lower in the hive, away from the honeycomb. To use the smoker, light the inside newspaper with a match and pump the smoke through the hose. Then, pry the lid off of your hive using a hive tool, and blow the smoke at the entrance of the hive and into the opening. The smoke from the smoker gives the bees the impression that the hive is on fire, so they begin to feast on the honey as a way to preserve it. Eating a lot of honey makes the bees get drowsy, so they are less likely to bother you as you get the wax caps out of the hive.

Mushroom starter kits are available online from websites that specialize in fungi. They most often come in the form of premade, ready-to-use grow blocks made of compacted substrate material like sawdust or straw. To begin growing the mushrooms, you simply wet and store the block. You can expect to pay around $20-25 for a basic starter kit. The price may be higher depending on the seasonal availability of certain varieties of mushrooms. A typical start kit contains enough materials to grow mushrooms continuously for 2-4 weeks.\\n2. If your container didn't come with a removable lid, drape a grocery bag or gallon-sized zipper bag lightly over the opening. This will help trap moisture inside, making it an optimal environment for speedy growth. Don't seal off or pin down the edges of the bag. Your mushrooms will need some air in order to grow. You can also use a couple wet strips of newspaper (or any other kind of lightweight paper) if you don't have a plastic bag on hand. Just make sure the saturated newspaper isn't heavy enough to weigh down the mushrooms as they emerge.\\n3. v4-460px-Grow-Enoki-Mushrooms-Step-2.jpg\\n4.

A rubric is a way of quantifying whatever it is you are trying to evaluate. This might involve assigning a letter grade based on your overall impression of the work (a holistic rubric) or giving points based on the degree to which the work meets specific criteria (an analytic rubric). Rubrics allow you to score students with different needs and backgrounds using a different scale. Consider the writer's background and current skill level when creating your rubric so you can differentiate your evaluation process. For example, an ESL student will have a different rubric than a native speaker who is also an honor student. If you’re not sure where to start, do an online search for example writing rubrics. This site offers a variety of rubric templates: http://rubistar.4teachers.org/index.php. A holistic rubric might assign a letter grade based on the overall clarity, organization, and technical proficiency of the writing. For example, you might say, “An ‘A’ paper will present the main argument clearly and support it with specific facts. It will also be free of grammatical and spelling errors.”\\nIn an analytic rubric, you will need to develop a numerical scoring system for the different criteria you will be looking at. For example, you might subtract 1 point for every grammatical error, or assign a range of points (0-10) for organization, fluency, or the degree to which the writing addresses the assignment topic.\\n1. Before you can assess a person’s writing skills, you must take their background into account. For example, you would not evaluate an ESL student’s writing the same way you would if they were a native English speaker. Consider such factors as:\\nThe writer’s age and developmental level. Their educational background and experience. Their familiarity with the language in which they will be writing.\\n2. v4-460px-Evaluate-Writing-Skills-Step-6.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Evaluate-Writing-Skills-Step-4.jpg\\n4. Writing a formal academic paper requires a very different skillset from writing a letter or a screenplay. Before you create a test or assignment, consider whether it reflects the types of writing skills you want to evaluate. For example, if you are testing the writer’s ability to use descriptive language, you might ask them to describe a piece of art in a few paragraphs, or to describe a photo of the countryside. If you want to assess their ability to convey information concisely, you could have them complete an assignment in a specific number of words or paragraphs. You may not be addressing the writer's immediate needs, especially if they're in a class you're teaching. However, you should be helping them work on a specific skill.\\n5. v4-460px-Evaluate-Writing-Skills-Step-2.jpg\\n6. Building writing skills is a process, and so is evaluating those skills. You will get a better idea of the writer’s abilities if you check in and provide feedback at multiple points during the writing process and assess how their writing improves and develops over time. For example, you might offer to provide feedback on drafts, and then look at how well they incorporate your suggestions into the final product. If you can, offer multiple assignments over a period of time, and provide feedback that encourages improvement and development.

What do you want to be able to do again – run a marathon, go back to aerobics class, play a sport? If you make goals and write them down, you're more likely to achieve them. Keep a workout journal to help you stay motivated. Write down your main goal, and then smaller goals for one week, two weeks, and one month. For instance, if your main goal is, “Run a marathon in a year,” don’t expect to start running 10 miles this week. Increase your goals gradually, starting with something like “Week 1: Walk for 30 minutes a day” and working up to “6 months: Run 10 miles 2-3 times per week.” Start as big or as small as is safe and comfortable for you. Be realistic and specific in your goals. “Walk 30 minutes a day” is more specific and motivating than “do some walking.” Write down your accomplishments to see how far you’ve come.\\n2. The best thing you can do when returning to exercise after being sick is to talk to your doctor about it. Depending on your illness there are probably specific things to work on and avoid.

Your doctor may refer you to a Physical Therapist or Occupational Therapist for professional help getting moving, depending on your needs. Say something to your doctor like, “Now that I’m feeling better I want to start a fitness regime. Can you help me make a safe plan?”\\nCall your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following during exercise: chest pain or tightness, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, nausea or vomiting, irregular heartbeat, numbness in your arms, lightheadedness, faintness, you pass out, or start to sweat profusely (more than would be expected for your activity level).\\n3. v4-460px-Start-a-Fitness-Regime-After-a-Long-Illness-Step-2.jpg\", 'question_id': 1008882, 'answer_choices': [[2, 0, 3, 1], [2, 1, 0, 3], [2, 3, 1, 0], [3, 0, 1, 2]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/100893.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Persuade-Your-Parents-to-Do-Something-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\\n1.

For the best results, germinate eggplant seeds in a soil-less growing medium. Fill seed trays 3/4 full with the growing medium of your choice. Vermiculite, perlite, coconut husk, and compost are all good options.\\n3. Eggplants seeds will grow as soon as 5 days or in as long as 2 weeks, depending on the temperature they are kept at. Warmer temperatures will spur a quicker germination period. Try to maintain a temperature of at least 65 °F (18 °C) for your eggplant seeds while they are germinating.\\n4. Eggplants need warmth, so it is best to start them indoors and transplant them once the weather is warm enough. Aim to germinate the seeds 6-9 weeks before the last frost of the year is predicted. Eggplants should not be re-planted outdoors until the temperature is at least 70 °F (21 °C). If you don\\'t wish to plan ahead this way, you can purchase eggplant seedlings directly from a gardening center or nursery.

If you are struggling to achieve a writing goal that you have set for yourself, it may be unrealistic for you. Lifestyle factors may be getting in the way or you may not be as invested in the project as you thought you would be. Change the parameters of your goal so that it is achievable and does not cause you stress. For example, if you are working on a novel and you're unable to attain your projected writing output of 20 pages a day, lower your goal to 10 pages a day.\\n1. Creating large, ambitious writing goals for yourself can sometimes be overwhelming. Begin by setting several small, attainable goals. Completing these will help build your confidence and prepare you for future projects. For instance, instead of planning to write a novel in 6 months, aim to produce 2-3 well-written short stories. Or, change your novel deadline to 2 years. Break larger projects down into more manageable steps.

Potassium can stress your kidneys, so you may need to eat less of it. Talk to your doctor or dietitian to get the best recommendation for you. In the meantime, choose low-potassium produce. Good produce choices include apples, grapes, strawberries, carrots, green beans, and cabbage. Produce that you should avoid includes bananas, oranges, spinach, tomatoes, and potatoes.\\n4.

If your doctor or dietitian suggests you eat less, you should follow their recommendation.\\n5. Diet is very important for managing CKD, as certain foods  contain nutrients, such as minerals, which are harder on your kidneys as they move through your digestive process. In general, your diet should consist of lean protein options, vegetables, and fruits. However, you’ll also need to follow specific recommendations about which foods to avoid, as well as how much protein you should consume. For example, red meat, eggs, dairy, and fish contain nutrients which stress your kidneys. Similarly, bananas, oranges, potatoes, tomatoes, and spinach can stress your kidneys, as well.

Start at the end of the branch and work your way toward the trunk of the tree. The nice thing about almonds is that you don’t have to pick them individually from the tree. Rubber mallets are used for harvesting many different kinds of nuts and can be purchased online or at a local garden supply store. If you don’t have a rubber mallet, you could also use a broom handle or a long plastic pole. Make sure to wear protective eyewear and a hard hat! The nuts will follow the mallet down toward you, so you want to protect your eyes and your head. There will also be a lot of dust floating around from the hulls, so keeping the debris out of your eyes is important.\\n2. Hull split will begin with the nuts at the top of the tree rather than the ones at eye level, so make sure to check the fruits that are higher up! Once the hull splits, you’ll be able to see the in-shell almond inside. Almonds in the U.S. most commonly come from California and harvesting will take place from early August to late September. In southern hemisphere locations, such as Australia, harvesting is done between February and April. The almond tree goes from dormancy during the winter months, to blossoming (flowers on the tree), to maturing of the nuts (this is when the flowers fall off and fuzzy gray fruit begins to grow), to fully mature nuts on the tree, and finally to hull-split. Then, you can harvest the nuts. The hull of the almond has a thick, leathery, green-gray coat with a fuzzy exterior (like a peach). Inside of the hull is a wood-like shell, and inside of that shell is where you find the actual nut, or kernel, that you eat. When a hull has split open, you will see the shell inside, and the brown shell should be starting to split open, too.

Pruning encourages the plant to grow, so the best time to trim the plant is at the very start of the growing season, which occurs during spring and summer. This way, the new growth will make your plant look full and healthy. If you like, you can prune your plant after it finishes blooming, instead, but since the pruning will cause the plant to grow, it's best to do at the start of the growing season.

When you’re pruning plumeria, you can use a knife, pruning shears, or a small saw. Older plumeria especially can get very woody, so a sharp tool is necessary to get a clean cut. Wear gardening gloves to protect your hands and improve your grip. For most plumeria plants, pruning shears are ideal. However, a pruning saw is a good option if you'll be cutting thicker plumeria branches, while a sharp knife would be ideal if you're pruning a younger, smaller plumeria plant. You can prevent the spread of harmful bacteria into the cuts by wiping the blade with rubbing alcohol before you start cutting as well as in between cuts.\\n5. When you’re getting ready to cut, locate the small knot at the base of a branch. This is the branch collar and is a part of the tree, and you should not cut it.

If your celery plant hasn’t reached this size by the time you want to harvest it, wait another week and measure the stalks.\\n1. The growing period for celery is much longer than 3 months, but they’re best when harvested immature. Wait for 3 months after transplanting, or 4 months after the seed was first started to harvest the stalks. The longer the celery grows, the tougher it will become. However, the tougher the celery, the more nutritious it tends to be. Harvest according to your personal preferences, but don’t wait longer than 5 months to harvest your first stalks!\\n2. It’s best to harvest whole plants that haven’t had any stalks removed. Check the top of the plant for open spaces between the stalks.

Your pruning tasks begin the first spring after you put the cypress in the ground. At the beginning of the growing season, look for the central, vertical branch at the plant’s center. Select 3 or 4 of the side branches to keep as leaders. Use a pair of loppers to sever any other branches at the base. The branches you choose should be the biggest, strongest ones, spaced out evenly along the cypress’ central branch.\\n2. Reach up to the top of your cypress. Given how quickly a Leyland cypress can extend out of your reach, you may need to set up a stepladder. Find the central, vertical branches hidden in the growth, then use loppers to prune each branch 6 in (15 cm) shorter than the final height you want the cypress to be. These branches grow back, eventually forming a thick top.

Indigo thrives in hot, sunny weather, so make sure your plot is in the sun most of the day. Check that the plot does not get shade from fences, houses, or other structures. The 6 hours of sun doesn't have to be continuous sun. For example, your plot could get 3 hours of sun in the morning and 3 hours of sun in the afternoon, with part shade in the middle of the day.

Indigo grows best in fertile, nutrient-rich soil, so you'll want to treat the soil in your plot. For best results, add the nutrients to the soil in the weeks before your planting. Mix the manure and fertilizer into the top 6 inches (15 cm) of soil. It’s best to till the manure and fertilizer into the soil, if you have a tiller. You can also buy pre-mixed soil from your local gardening center. Look for 1 that contains fertilizer and is meant to be used in a plot rather than pots.\\n4. This type of indigo tolerates cold weather best, though it may not thrive if your area has long winters, meaning longer than 4 months. It's a subshrub, which means it's thinner than a shrub, and will grow to about 3 to 6 feet (0.91 to 1.83 m). Keep in mind that Isatis tintoria has only 1/4 of the dye pigment contained in other varieties of indigo, so it may need additional plants if you want to create your own dye. Although indigo plants are perennials, they behave as an annual in non-tropical climates. However, varieties other than Isatis tinctoria may not grow into full-sized plants in non-tropical regions.

Look for seeds starting to form on your plant in groupings near the leaves. Waiting too long into the growing season makes the fibers too coarse and male fibers die soon after the plants pollinate.

Cleaning up at your local beach can be as simple as grabbing a reusable bag and some gloves and heading to the nearest beach. Grab pieces of trash like bottles, plastic, and other waste, and throw them in a trash can when you’re done. You can also set up an organized beach clean-up through your local parks service. Go to their website for more information. If you don’t live near a beach, clean up a local lake or river. You can even pick up trash at a nearby park; trash that starts there can easily end up in a body of water.\\n1. v4-460px-Celebrate-World-Oceans-Day-Step-6.jpg\\n2. Eating fish, even when it’s farmed or from a sustainable fishery, can put a lot of strain on marine ecosystems. Give the ocean a break today by incorporating seafood-inspired recipes into your meal while skipping out on the fish itself. You’ll be able to enjoy the flavor of the sea while knowing that you’re helping to protect it! You can make your favorite seafood dishes without the fish by replacing it with foods that emulate its texture. You can replace fish or crab cakes with tempeh, and use tofu instead of scallops or shrimp. Use seafood-inspired flavorings like Old Bay seasoning, seaweed, and lemon and serve your dish with classic condiments like tartar sauce. Try skipping out on meat as well.

Once you choose to become cold hearted toward someone, you must remain firm in your decision to do so. Keep reminding yourself why it is critical to your own well-being and happiness that you cut ties and close off your affections for this person.

This is non-negotiable.”\\nCutting ties in this fashion is a harsh and challenging measure, so save it for instances in which a relationship is clearly detrimental and irreparable.\\n1. Do not reflect on the \"good times\" you might have shared. You can’t be cold hearted while having fond memories.

This will arguably be the hardest thing, especially if you're alone or wounded. But ultimately this hardship will be easier to handle if you remain optimistic about it. And if there are children with you, all the more reason. Do not let your ethics stand in the way of your identity. The rules are different now.

Wrap the measuring tape around your back and measure your breasts at their fullest point, usually at the nipple. Write down this measurement.

Don't pull the tape tight like you did with your band measurement. As with the band measurement, round up to the nearest whole number if your measurement is a fraction.

A common symptom of veterans’ PTSD is to avoid being reminded of their traumatic events. Thinking about the traumatic experience can be terrifying, and so traumatized veterans can go to great lengths to avoid situations that remind them of their trauma. For example, a traumatized army veteran may avoid watching TV or movies that have any depiction of violence or war. Traumatized veterans may also go so far as to avoid conversations about war or violence, and may change the topic if these subjects come up. Conversely, some veterans may seek out risky behaviors and environments to help cope with PTSD. If you notice a veteran engaging in uncharacteristically risky or extreme behavior, this may also be a sign of PTSD.\\n2. Veterans with PTSD often struggle to control their behavior or emotional responses, and may show anger in response to a disproportionately small stimulus. Irritable behavior can include inappropriately angry or panicked reactions. For example, a veteran with PTSD may become furious over something that, prior to their traumatic experience, would’ve produced a much less dramatic response.\\n3. v4-460px-Recognize-PTSD-in-Veterans-Step-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10094281, 'answer_choices': [[2, 3, 1, 0], [1, 2, 3, 0], [2, 3, 1, 0], [3, 0, 2, 1]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10094902.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Dispose-of-Furniture-Step-2.jpg\\n1. These companies work like conventional trash-pickup organizations, except that they specialize in picking up large objects, including furniture.

If your home has been painted before, remove all previous paintwork using a manual paint scraper. Paint scrapers are great for working in corners and tight spaces and sharp scrapers do the best job. You may find layers and layers of old paint if your house has been painted several times over the years, which all has to be removed for new paint to adhere to the wood surface underneath. Use a stout unhandled scraper with a curved blade, a drop cloth to catch the old paint, and safety goggles. A smaller scraper can also be used to get into nooks and crannies.These are all available from your local hardware store. Divide the area to be scraped into parts. Scraping a whole house is a time-consuming job, so it’s good to achieve small victories in the process. A pocket radio can also help overcome the monotony of scraping. A Sony Walkman radio from Kmart costs about $15, so don’t destroy your iPod or smartphone in the process. Always scrape with the grain of the wood and use a solid pressure, but don’t overdo it or gouge the surface. The idea is to return the wood to its original flatness in preparation for painting. To finish, scrape lightly against the grain to remove any remaining edges, if necessary. Use the smaller scraper to get into those harder to reach cracks and corners. Keep your work area well-ventilated, keep plants and animals away, and clean up the paint debris with a vacuum cleaner as you go.\\n4. v4-460px-Paint-Weathered-Wood-Step-8.jpg\\n5. Begin by wiping down the prepared surface with a wet cloth or sponge to remove excess sawdust. Ensure that every inch of the wood is wet - it should be damp but not dripping. Repeat this process until the surface is mostly clean. Wash off the remaining dust with a low-pressure hose that won’t break your windows. Scrub the surface with soapy water using a mild detergent and a stiff bristled broom or brush. Ensure you rinse off the soap residue before finishing.\\n6. Now that you have removed all rot and checked the wood’s integrity, use a solvent-based wood filler to seal all gaps where moisture could penetrate the surface again, especially in corners, seams and edges. Heavy-duty solvent-based wood fillers are designed for outdoor use. You can fill in nail holes, gouges or cracks, having already removed loose and flaking paint on the wood surface. Ensure the surface is clean and free of dust by using a damp cloth. Choose a filler that’s best for the job. You want your filler to expand and contract with the wood and not break away. Note that some epoxy fillers need to be mixed first to properly adhere to the wooden surface. Using a putty knife, apply the filler to the edge of the damaged area such as a hole, and gradually move to the centre. Always overfill the holes so the filler will shrink down when it dries, ready for sanding. Smooth over the filled area with a clean part of the knife. Allow the filler to dry. This can take anywhere between 15 minutes to 8 hours, so be sure to read the instructions on the filler.\\n7. Some types of rot can be repaired, but to be on the safe side, you should remove as much rot as possible before painting weathered wood, and take a few simple steps to prevent the conditions that could cause it to come back. Using a sharp tool such as a painter’s 5 in 1 or a Swiss Army knife, thoroughly remove all traces of rot in the wood. Cut around and gouge out the infected area. A wood chisel can also be a handy tool in this process. Get rid of the conditions that cause rot to grow to prevent it from coming back.

This is the most important reason for deciding to prune. If you catch a diseased portion before it spreads throughout the whole plant, you can save a cactus from being completely destroyed. Fungi and bacteria are the most common type of disease the cacti face. Dry rot or fungal growth are often clear, visual signs that something is amiss with your plant and should be treated immediately.\\n2. In certain climates, cacti can really take off, growing far beyond what might be intended for your garden. If the plant becomes disproportionate or is beginning to bend and break due to the weight of overgrowth, pruning the cactus back can help to bring things back to a more balanced state. Look for leaning sections that might even have clear breaks in the plant to determine if overgrowth is occurring. Sometimes a plant has simply grown too tall or wide for its setting. This is more of a visually challenging procedure, but a smaller, well-pruned cactus can simply look better.\\n3. Whether or not you are cutting away diseased portions, having clean tools can make sure that the pruning does not affect the cactus more than is needed. Padded and prickly pear style cacti usually can be pruned with smaller pruning shears or garden clippers. The larger columnar cacti will more likely need a saw. Tools should be cleaned with soap and warm water, or if they have been used on diseased plant material already, use ¼ cup of bleach to 1 gallon of water. Select heavier clothing that will not only cover as much skin as possible but will also prevent the cactus spines from penetrating the cloth and hurting you. Since you will be working with your hands, leather gloves are perhaps the most important component to keeping yourself from getting pricked. You may also wish to tape your sleeve cuffs over your gloves to prevent spines from falling up into your sleeve. The same can be done with pant cuffs at your ankle in case you are walking into a denser section of cacti to prune.\\n4. v4-460px-Prune-Cactus-Step-4.jpg', 'question_id': 10094934, 'answer_choices': [[1, 0, 2, 4, 3], [3, 2, 0, 1, 4], [4, 3, 1, 0, 2], [4, 3, 2, 0, 1]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10094964.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

Because the jade plant is top-heavy and stores water in its leaves, branches that aren’t thick enough won’t be able to support the weight of the leaves. Pruning those branches develops thicker, stronger stems, which lets your plant grow taller and wider. Don’t prune young plants (under 1 year old). They are still developing their roots and trunk during the first year, and pruning them too soon will permanently stunt their growth.\\n1. v4-460px-Prune-a-Jade-Plant-Step-2.jpg\\n2. Prune back branches that are drooping by clipping the branch where it intersects with the trunk. Or if you are mainly looking to shape your jade plant, prune individual leaves or partial sections of branches. Cut just above the leaf node (where the leaf grows out of the branch). Avoid cutting the main branch (or trunk) of the plant. This is the main section that connects to the roots. The only time you will cut this main truck is when you are cutting down most of the plant to help it heal from infection. Give branches enough space so they aren’t touching or rubbing each other.

Make sure the tubes are not held loosely. If they are, undo the knot, and pull it tighter. Tie a double knot for added security.\\n3. Determine how many tubes you need to connect together. Buy at least 3 to 4 feet (0.91 to 1.22 m) of rope for each tube you’re tied to. Use a rope no thicker than ⁄2 inch (13 mm) in diameter since it will be more of a burden to tie.

Napa cabbage does best during the spring or fall, though fall is the best option. If you plant in mid- to late summer, the plants will mature as the temperatures are dropping. Prepare the soil in winter for a spring planting or mid-summer for a fall planting. If you're planting in spring, generally, you'll plant after the last estimated frost. Many local gardening sites will list the last estimated frost for your area. Napa cabbage can survive a light frost in the 30 to 32 °F (−1 to 0 °C) range, but not a heavy frost. Plant 70-80 days ahead of when the first major frosts are expected in your area.\\n1. v4-460px-Grow-Napa-Cabbage-Step-4.jpg\\n2. Napa cabbage prefers well-draining soil. Clay soil, for instance, can hold too much water, while sandy soil can be too dry. Test the soil to see how it drains before planting. To test the soil, dig a hole in your garden that's 1 foot (0.30 m) deep and about the same wide. Fill it with water, and let it drain out. Fill it again, and use a ruler to measure the depth. Measure the depth again every 1-2 hours. It should drop about 1 inch (2.5 cm) per hour. If the soil is draining too fast or too slow, mix in peat moss, manure, compost, or shredded bark to fix the problem.\\n3. Start by digging a small hole and filling it with distilled water. Let it get muddy in the hole. Insert the test probe, and check the readout for the soil. You can find these kits at your local home improvement store. Add limestone to the soil if you need to raise the pH or sulfur if you need to lower it. You should be able to find these additives at your local gardening store. You can sprinkle them on top of the soil or mix them in.\\n4. v4-460px-Grow-Napa-Cabbage-Step-2.jpg\", 'question_id': 10096287, 'answer_choices': [[0, 4, 3, 2, 1], [4, 0, 2, 1, 3], [0, 4, 3, 1, 2], [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10097153.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Treat-an-Air-Embolism-Step-2.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Treat-an-Air-Embolism-Step-4.jpg\\n2. Embolisms can outwardly look a lot like a heart attack or stroke, and they are just as serious. Call emergency services as soon as possible, as medical intervention will be necessary to treat an embolism. Signs of an embolism include low blood pressure, dizziness, rapid breathing, muscle pain, tingling skin, paralysis, cyanosis, and loss of consciousness. If you notice any of these symptoms in a person, call emergency services immediately. You do not have to be sure it is an embolism before you call. A doctor can make the diagnosis, you just need to help get the symptomatic individual to the hospital. Provide 100% oxygen through a close-fitting mask. Breathing 100% oxygen as early as possible will help mitigate any breathing issues caused by the embolism. Begin administering emergency oxygen as soon as an embolism is suspected. If you do not have emergency oxygen training, follow the instructions in the emergency oxygen kit closely as you begin to administer the gas. If you do not have access to an emergency oxygen kit, let your emergency services contact know. The coming first responders will supply pure oxygen as soon as possible.\\n3. Venous embolisms are especially common in a person’s lower extremities. The symptoms may be similar to those of a blood clot, and include swelling, hardness, and redness. If you notice these symptoms in conjunction with other air embolism symptoms, adjust the person’s position so that they are lying on their left side, and their feet are 15 to 30 degrees above their head. As with an arterial embolism, you do not need to be able to diagnose a venous embolism with 100% certainty to adjust their position. A doctor can make that diagnosis in the hospital using a CT scan or other imaging tests. Treatment for a venous embolism often requires surgery. A venous embolism is when an air bubble blocks a vein, which is the type of blood vessel that carries oxygen-depleted blood back to the heart. The purpose of the side-lying, feet-elevated position is to lower the risk of air traveling from a vein to the heart and into an artery. If air bubbles clot an artery, a major organ’s blood supply might become blocked.', 'question_id': 10097153, 'answer_choices': [[2, 1, 3, 0], [1, 0, 3, 2], [1, 3, 2, 0], [2, 0, 3, 1]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10097225.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Remove-Rust-from-Carpet-Step-6.jpg\\n1. If the stain came from a piece of furniture or a plant stand, move it off of the carpet before you start the cleaning process. You may want to permanently relocate the offending piece of furniture to protect your carpet from future stains. Rust stains happen when iron or steel, oxygen, and moisture combine.\\n2. Use a bowl or a bucket to mix your stain removal mixture—just make sure it is clean before you add the water and soap to avoid transferring any dirt or dye to your carpet.

If you dislike the smell of the ammonia, try adding 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of lemon juice into the mixture.\\n5. v4-460px-Remove-Rust-from-Carpet-Step-4.jpg\\n6.

If an item in your wardrobe looks like something someone half your age would wear, or if you did wear it when you were half your current age, it has to go.\\n2. Everyone comes in different sizes and shapes, and it’s normal for bodies to change as they age. Take a good look at your current size and shape and be honest with yourself about which areas are flattering and should be accentuated, and which areas may need more special attention. An apple-shaped body tends to be heavier around the midsection. Choose clothing that is loose around the middle, and fits snugly everywhere else. A pear-shaped body will be small on top around your shoulders and torso, and wider on the bottom around your hips and thighs. Choose clothing that accentuates your top half and makes it look more proportioned to your bottom half. An hourglass figure has a larger chest and hips in comparison to your waist. Choose clothing that nicely accentuates your curves. A rectangle-shaped body is mostly straight up and down, with no curves. Choose clothing that defines your waist and helps your top and bottom appear more curvy.

Okra matures about 50-65 days after it has been planted. It’s at this point that the okra can begin being harvested to eat. Wait several weeks after this point to save the seeds. The pods will become hard and woody, and will turn brown. Some varieties may grow up to 6–9 inches (15–23 cm) before they begin to dry out. Watch the plant daily. This is so you can remove the dried pod once it begins to split. If you wait too long, it may split completely open and release the seeds before you have a chance to collect them.\\n3. You can use a mason jar or a plastic container or baggie. Keep the seeds in a cool, dry place like a kitchen pantry or in the refrigerator.

Once the temperature gauge gets up to where it normally is while the car is running, you should still wait a few minutes after that before accelerating quickly with the turbocharger, as the coolant will get warm before the oil. Often, your \"running temperature\" will be midway up on the cool-to-hot temperature scale.\\n3.

In addition, flooring it in a high gear can push too high a gas mixture into your catalytic converter and other engine parts, which can tear them up. Flooring it in high gear can also damage your engine, as it can cause the engine to spark before the spark plugs do their job, and then the spark is not as controlled.

Screening for diverticulitis generally starts with a standard physical unless you’re experiencing extreme symptoms. Your doctor will check your overall health profile, along with examining your abdomen for tenderness or signs of pain. If you are experiencing serious symptoms or severe pain, seek emergency medical treatment right away. If you experience sharp pain that is localized to 1 part of your abdomen, this is a sign of a medical emergency. You may experience this type of localized pain with either diverticulitis or appendicitis, and it will be extremely severe (a 10 on the numeric pain scale).\\n2. During a CT scan, an x-ray technician will use a combination of x-rays and computer imaging to create a comprehensive image of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This procedure is painless, and requires you to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel to capture the x-rays. The images are then used to check for both diverticulosis and diverticulitis. Prior to your scan, your technician may give you a solution to drink and an injection of a dye called a contrast medium. This medium makes it easier to see inside your body during the procedure.\\n3. This procedure uses a chalky liquid called barium to make your large intestine more visible on x-rays. During this process, you will lie flat on a table, and your radiologist will use a thin, flexible tube to fill your large intestine with barium. They will then take x-ray images to check for the pouches that cause diverticulitis. This procedure may cause some discomfort. Generally, though, the discomfort is not so great that you will need anesthesia. The night before your procedure, your doctor may provide you with a set of instructions to help you empty your bowel as much as possible. If they do, follow them closely.

Most people have most of their wealth in retirement accounts. You should have named beneficiaries to receive your benefits after your death. Check whether you named the disabled heir as a beneficiary.

You can avoid this problem by naming the special needs trust as the beneficiary. However, leaving retirement benefits to a special needs trust has negative tax consequences.

She may feel more comfortable with a low light than complete darkness. Visit your local home improvement store to learn more about low lighting options for your cat.\\n2. When your cat is nearing the end of her life, it is extremely important for her to be comfortable in her own space. She will need a calm, quiet environment that is free of noisy activity and chaos. For example, if you have other pets, you may need to restrict their access to her. Consider moving your cat’s rest area to a part of your house that does not get much activity or noise. If moving your cat’s rest area to a different room would be too much of a change for her, then you should adjust your habits, as well as those of your family, to decrease the amount of activity and noise around your cat. Allow your cat choose where to sleep. She may naturally choose an area that will give her the peace and quiet she desires. Playing soft, low music for your cat could make her feel more comfortable. Examples of soothing music are singing birds and running water.

While time consuming, removing tomato worms by hand can be very effective. Adult tomato worms have a horn-like protrusion on their rear.

By introducing a predator insect you can help control your tomato worm problem and benefit your garden at the same time. There are many of these insects that can help. Wasps feed on tomato worms and attach their larvae to them. Once attached, the wasp larvae will feed on the tomato worm until it is dead. If you see tomato worms with wasp larvae attached (they will look like tiny grains of rice on the back of the caterpillars) remove them from your garden but do not kill them. This way any damage will end but the wasps can still do their jobs and it will help populate your garden with wasps. Ladybugs and lacewings are also beneficial insects if you would prefer not to have many wasps around. These insects eat tomato worms, rather than lay their eggs on them as the wasps do. Birds are also an option as they can easily spot the worms and eat them.

To decide on consolidating private loans, you’ll have to shop around. Compare loan servicing agents like Chase, NextStudent, Student Loan Network, and Wells Fargo, which are highly rated by Forbes. As you compare consolidation loans with various private companies, pay particular attention to the interest rate – this will make a huge difference in how much you wind up paying overall. For federal student loans, there’s no question – you are better off consolidating with the Department of Education, where interest rates are capped and you keep your access to programs like deferment, forbearance, and forgiveness.\\n3. After comparing all the data, you just need to make a choice. Choose the consolidation program that best fits your needs. This will be the loan that creates a monthly payment that you can afford, while keeping the total cost in a range that you are satisfied with. If the rebate is important to you, then choose the lender with the best rebate offer. Understand that some rebate offers appear attractive at the time, but over the length of the loan an offer of a lower interest rate may wind up saving you much more money. The choice is yours.\\n4. Lenders will generally advertise the incentives that they offer, in order to get your attention and get your business. However, you still may have to ask. When you find a lender that you think looks promising, and you find an interest rate that you believe you can afford, find out if they offer a rebate program for consolidating. Ask the following questions:\\nDo they offer a rebate for consolidating student loans? Do your particular loans qualify for the rebate? Is the rebate a fixed amount, or is it a percentage of the amount of your loans? How much can you receive? Is the rebate issued to you in cash, or is it only available to deduct the loan amount?

Anti-inflammatory skin creams and gels can be effective in treating mild pain and inflammation. Apply a topical NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) directly to your elbow and massage it into your skin gently. For the best results, do this 4 times throughout the day. Some topical NSAIDs can be purchased over-the-counter at your local pharmacy, while others require a prescription from your doctor. Topical NSAIDs should not be used to treat inflammation due to a fracture or torn tendon. Do not use topical NSAIDs if you have a history of ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding since it is absorbed through  the skin into the bloodstream. Discontinue using topical NSAIDs if you experience redness, irritation, stomach or esophageal pain, or rash.\\n2. Compressing the swollen area around your elbow will help to reduce inflammation. Wrap an elastic bandage or compression wrap around the affected area and secure it with a safety pin or medical tape. Remove the wrap if your arm begins to feel numb or sore.

All styles of trampoline anchors, including U-shaped wind stakes, are designed to be used on soft surfaces, such as grass, dirt, or clay. If the ground beneath your trampoline is too hard to easily sink the stakes, spray it lightly with a garden hose to soften it up.

Don\\'t question yourself or your abilities. Be sure of yourself. Always be polite and show respect to the girls around you. In order to be polite and respectful, never force anyone to do anything they don\\'t want to do. In addition, don\\'t think you know what they want or what they think. Always ask people their opinions and thank them when appropriate. Remember, you do not need to patronize or treat women in an inferior manner to act like a gentleman. Simply remember to be considerate and thoughtful. To be more considerate, always think of others as you are doing something. Ask yourself \"how do my words or actions affect other people?\"\\n5. Another way to gain the admiration of girls is to be a good listener. Good listeners do just that – they listen. When you truly listen to people, you send the signal that you care about them.

Avoid praising results, such as a great test score, or qualities, such as being smart or athletic. Instead, praise your child for studying hard or for practicing to get better at their sport. For instance, tell your child, “I'm proud of you for spending so much time studying for your test. Your hard work really paid off!”\\nPraising fixed qualities can discourage kids from challenging themselves. It can also lead to self-esteem pitfalls if they don’t perform at their best level. If you praise their effort, they’re more likely to see failure as a chance to grow instead of as permanent and insurmountable.\\n3. If they misbehave, avoid harsh criticism such as, “What’s wrong with you?” or “Can’t you do anything right?” Focus on addressing the behavior instead of criticizing who they are. Deliver consequences that are related to the misbehavior, and make sure they understand why what they did is wrong. For instance, if your child colored on the walls, make them clean it up and restrict their coloring privileges for the rest of the day.

Klare Heston, LCSW\\t\\t\\tClinical Social Worker\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat you say to your child can affect their self-esteem. Klare Heston, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, explains, “Low self-esteem in children tends to be caused by believing negative things about themselves. These are usually things they hear from those around them—especially their parents. Also, if they are encouraged to be 'perfect,' that lowers self-esteem.”\\n4. Feeling capable is the foundation of self-esteem, so teach your child how to perform age-appropriate tasks. If you have a younger child, teach them how to tie their shoes, get dressed, read, and catch a ball. Have your middle schooler or teen help you cook, and teach them how to do laundry, vacuum, and other household tasks. The first time you teach your child a new skill, do the task yourself and explain each action. For instance, say, “First, butter the bread from crust to crust, like this. Put a slice of bread in the pan, add the cheese, and top it with the other slice of bread. Cook it over medium heat for 3 or 4 minutes, or until it’s golden, then flip it and grill the other side.”\\n5. v4-460px-Teach-Self-Esteem-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\", 'question_id': 10110515, 'answer_choices': [[3, 0, 2, 1, 5, 4], [3, 2, 4, 0, 5, 1], [0, 5, 2, 4, 3, 1], [4, 0, 2, 1, 3, 5]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10110534.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Grow-Jasmine-from-Cuttings-Step-2.jpg\\n1.

Open the door enough to provide access to the hinges. Use a hammer to tap the hinge pin out from the bottom and set it aside.

Disassemble the knob or handle, hinge plates, latches, locks, and any other fixtures that might get in the way while you're staining. The idea is to strip the door down to a single piece so you can work quickly and efficiently. Most door hardware can easily be removed using a screwdriver, but other tools like an adjustable wrench, pliers, and a hammer may also come in handy. Temporarily store screws and other small pieces in labelled bags or jars to avoid losing them.\\n4. If you're renewing a door that's been stained previously, it will be necessary to first get rid of the old finish. You can do this by slathering it with a thin coat of chemical solvent, which will slowly liquefy the dried stain. Let the solvent sit for 3-5 minutes, then wipe away all traces of chemical residue using a disposable rag. Chemical solvents give off harmful fumes, so be sure to wear a respirator or facemask and work in a well-ventilated area to minimize your exposure.

The wood should be dry to the touch once it is finished; if it feels sticky or if your fingers drag when you run your hand over it, it isn’t dry yet.\\n1. Sanding is going to make the wood grains even and more receptive to the stain-blocking primer. Use 120-grit sandpaper and rub it back and forth over the surface of the wood until it is smooth to the touch. Wipe dust off periodically to check your progress. Use a sanding block for a firmer hold on the sandpaper. This gives you a better grip as you sand back and forth and protects your hands from the rough sandpaper.\\n2. An oil-based primer does have a strong smell and requires paint thinner for cleanup, but it is the most reliable in blocking stains from knotty wood, water, or wood that naturally stains (like redwood, cedar, and mahogany). An oil-based primer is also helpful in eliminating strong odors from pieces of wood. For example, if you are restoring an antique piece of furniture that smells like smoke even after it has been sanded down, applying the oil-based primer will help to trap that scent in. If you are going to paint with a darker color, you can tint your primer (which is almost always white) so it’ll be easier to cover with your choice of paint.\\n3. v4-460px-Stop-Stains-Bleeding-Through-Paint-Step-4.jpg\\n4. Primer often has a very strong smell, so you want to make sure to work in a space that gets lots of circulated air, or even work outdoors if the weather is nice. If you are working indoors, set up a fan to blow the fumes outside while you work.

You can do your relaxation techniques to help you stay calm during moments you’re more likely to sweat. For example, you might use a relaxation technique before giving a big presentation at work. Here are some great ways to relax:\\n\\nMeditate to calm your mind and lower your heart rate. This can help you calm down before a big meeting or after an upsetting situation occurs. Do yoga daily to keep your stress levels under control. Start your day with a short yoga practice, or use it to calm down after work. Over time, it will help you maintain a calm demeanor. Do breathing exercises to calm down when you feel stressed. For example, you can use them to calm down in traffic or just before you give a presentation.\\n2. Caffeine is a common culprit behind excessive sweating, and it can make your sweat smell worse. Skip coffee, soda, and caffeinated tea if you want your face to stay dry. If you love coffee, you could try switching to decaffeinated coffee. Avoid hot beverages when you’re sweating. Drink 8 cups (1,900 ml) of water a day to stay hydrated throughout the day.\\n3. v4-460px-Stop-Face-Sweating-Step-8.jpg\\n4. It will temporarily block your sweat glands from producing sweat. Most people apply antiperspirant at night before bed. However, for facial sweating you may prefer to apply it in the morning after washing your face. Don't get the antiperspirant in your eyes, nose, or mouth. You may want to cover the center of your face when you apply the product to protect it, such as with a towel. Talk to your doctor before using an antiperspirant on your face.\\n5. Sweat is the natural reaction that your body has to becoming overheated, so staying cool is the simplest way to stop sweating. Turn down the thermostat to make your space cooler, if you can. You can also use a fan to stay cool. For example, keep a fan at your workstation to blow on your face. When you're on the go, you can take a portable fan. This allows you to blow cool air on your face, even on the hottest of days.\\n6. v4-460px-Stop-Face-Sweating-Step-6.jpg\\n7. v4-460px-Stop-Face-Sweating-Step-4.jpg\", 'question_id': 10113415, 'answer_choices': [[6, 5, 3, 2, 7, 1, 0, 4], [2, 4, 5, 3, 1, 6, 7, 0], [5, 0, 4, 7, 2, 6, 1, 3], [6, 5, 2, 0, 3, 7, 4, 1]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1011349.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

Dogs actually stand and walk on the toes of their front and rear legs. When a dog is standing, you will see its ankle on its hind leg between the knee and the toes.

If you don’t have a lot of teaching experience, getting a community college teaching certificate may help. These are not regulatory certifications, so they are not required for community colleges.

Most community colleges require at least a Master’s level degree in a subject before you can get a job as an instructor. Before you start the application process, you need to have your Master’s in-hand in a subject relevant to the one you want to teach. A relevant degree should be a degree in the same field as or a field closely adjacent to the subject you intend to teach. For example, if you have a degree in archaeology, you may be fit to teach in either anthropology or history departments. You likely won't be considered for a teaching position in the business school, though. An increased rate of people pursuing advanced degrees means that an increased number of PhDs are now working at the community college level. If you just have your Master’s, understand that you may start out with a single class or a part-time appointment.

Bad behavior in a child is infuriating, and it’s very difficult to get beyond the frustration you rightly feel.

Some things to remember about life from your teenager’s point of view include:\\nEgocentrism, or the belief that their interpretation of the situation is the only possible correct interpretation is a normal part of cognitive development. Your child’s brain is developing the capability to grow beyond egocentrism, but it’s not finished yet. For example, when they were three, they might stand in front of the TV and not understand that just because they could see the TV didn’t mean that others in the room could see through their body. As teenagers, they’ve developed beyond that — but there’s still a ways to go. Your teenager’s brain is developing in a way that allows them to grasp abstraction in a new way, and for the first time. Injustices seem to be everywhere — but without the wisdom that comes with life experience, and without the cognitive ability to flesh out the logical repercussions of their abstract thinking. Because of this, they get incredibly worked up about things that seem insignificant from an adult’s perspective. But remember that their brains are still developing important cognitive functions that will allow them to see the way you, as an adult, do with time.\\n8. Pay attention to the situations that seem to elicit the worst behavior from your teenager. It may be that your child is most irritable immediately after school, but that they calm down after they’ve had a snack or nap. It may be that they act out more when they have a lot of work for school, or when they’re fighting with a friend or significant other. By being alert to the situations that trigger your teen’s worst behavior, you have a choice to either give them more leeway or to proactively lessen their stress. Be proactive by making their lives easier: have snacks waiting in the kitchen after school; help them with their homework; etc.', 'question_id': 1011472, 'answer_choices': [[2, 3, 0, 8, 5, 1, 7, 4, 6], [4, 3, 7, 2, 6, 0, 5, 8, 1], [4, 0, 3, 7, 1, 5, 2, 8, 6], [3, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 8, 0, 7]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1011491.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. You should also consider what other possibilities all of these different signs might indicate. It is possible that your guy friend is not gay but instead falls somewhere else on the Kinsey scale of unicorns and awesomeness. He could be:\\nBisexual, meaning he\\'s interested in men and women. Asexual, meaning that he naturally has no sexual desire. He may just not be interested in you, if you\\'re wondering why he hasn\\'t made a move on you.\\n1. When someone is closeted, they often have to hide a lot of things about themselves. Your friend might even be out, just not to you, which means they have to hide a whole other life. Watch for signs that they\\'re hiding something or that they\\'re ashamed or embarrassed about something, since this can be an indication. For example, if you invite him to go do something else during the same weekend as the Pride festival and he says that he is busy, that might be an indication.\\n2. Listen when your friend talks and see what he says about other men. Does he frequently refer to other guys as being attractive? Does he gush about his favorite male characters on television or the latest hot-topic celebrity? Does he get all tongue tied around the quarterback or the office stud? Things like this can be a cue that he likes them with a little bit more than basic admiration. For example, if he says something like, \"Oh man, I spent all weekend hanging out with Jacob.

Commercial rust penetrant often comes in a spray bottle, so all you need to do is point the nozzle and shoot. Spray a lot of penetrant around the screw's head.

When you're just starting out, research local startup companies and offer your services to their founders. Larger companies look for coaches who are certified by a professional organization. In order to become certified, you'll need a minimum amount of paid coaching experience. The best way to gain this early experience is by working with small, locally-owned businesses.

Doing so can damage the vine and make it more susceptible to infection and disease. Use garden shears to get a nice, clean cut on all shoots and stems. Cut shoots so that they are flush with the main stem—do not leave a stub. Cut the stem about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above a bud that is pointing in the direction you want the vine to grow.

The first step in getting a boy to kiss you is to have utterly kissable, irresistible lips. Nobody wants to kiss dry, cracked lips so get a good lip balm and apply it frequently for perfectly hydrated lips. Before the actual kissing, you should apply a light layer of lip balm so your lips are smooth and perhaps delicately flavoured. You should avoid bright lipsticks and sticky lip glosses however, as these can get messy and even ruin your kiss. For moisturization, petroleum jelly or a lip balm stick will work well. You can also try exfoliating your lips by gently rubbing them with a damp washcloth or toothbrush. This will get them extra smooth. If you have a date planned, try preparing your lips a couple of days in advance. Otherwise you should keep some lip balm in your purse for emergency situations.\\n1. v4-460px-Get-a-Boy-to-Kiss-You-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n2. This probably goes without saying, but you should always try your best to have fresh breath whenever there\\'s a chance of kissing. You can do this by brushing your teeth as often as possible, especially after eating. You should also keep a little tin of breath mints in your purse, so you can pop one as soon as things look promising. Don\\'t be afraid to offer him one either, he might take it as a hint, which is exactly what you want! Try carrying a travel-size toothbrush and toothpaste in your purse if you\\'re planning on grabbing a bite with the boy you like. That way you can pop to the restroom for a quick refresher after eating. If possible, use a little mouthwash as well. You should also try to avoid eating foods with a lot of garlic, anything too spicy or anything that might make you burp (not attractive) before or during a date.\\n3. v4-460px-Get-a-Boy-to-Kiss-You-Step-2.jpg\\n4. You shouldn\\'t work yourself up about the kiss too much. Of course, it\\'s normal to be nervous, but too many nerves can cause you to act jittery or distracted, which might send him the wrong signals. Kissing should be a fun, enjoyable, natural thing, not complicated or terrifying at all. But if those butterflies are feeling more like carnivorous moths, there are a few last-minute relaxation techniques you can try:\\n\\nTake a few deep breaths. If you feel the panic rising, take several deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. Focus on the breathing and nothing else and you will immediately feel calmer, as deep breathing is associated with decreased production of anxiety-inducing chemicals like adrenaline and increased production of relaxing and mood-boosting endorphins. Ask yourself \"what\\'s the worst that can happen?\" Really - think about what could possibly go wrong with a simple kiss. Are you afraid that you\\'re not a good kisser? Or that he won\\'t like you any more if it\\'s bad? Remember that kissing is a natural thing, so it\\'s very unlikely that you\\'ll be bad at it, especially if you like him and he likes you. And even if the kiss isn\\'t so great, if that\\'s enough to turn this guy off an otherwise amazing girl, then he\\'s not worth your time anyway. Laugh. They say laughter is the best medicine, and that goes for nerves too. Laughing will immediately make you feel more relaxed and happy and make the whole situation less awkward. Try cracking a joke (even a bad one), making a funny face or whipping out some silly dance moves to break the ice and get both of you laughing.

If your job requires constant standing, take measures to provide anti-fatigue matting to help prevent heel pain and take care of your plantar fascia ligaments.\\n1. Prevent heel pain and plantar fasciitis by discarding shoes with worn soles and heels. Worn soles and heels contribute to an uneven step with heel counters that have lost some of their support. Discard old shoes and replace with new ones that have the proper support.\\n2. The importance of stretches cannot be over-emphasized. Tight calf muscles can contribute to heel pain. The Achilles tendon stretches from the bone in the heel into the calf area. Flexibility in this area can be improved by properly stretching before and after exercise. Performing exercises that stretch your feet can help to maintain the integrity of the plantar fascia ligament and prevent heel pain. Do three stretching exercises for your feet before and after exercising. The first involves standing with your hands placed on a wall and the toes of one foot also against the wall. Place one foot back, and keep your heel on the ground as you lean into the wall. Hold this for 30 seconds, switch legs and repeat. You can also follow the straight leg stretch by bending your back leg slightly. By doing the stretch both ways you will be able to stretch two different muscles in the back of your calf, the soleus and the gastrocnemius. While seated and without shoes, hold your toes and gently pull them upward until you can feel the arch of your foot stretch. Hold for 30 seconds, switch feet, and repeat. Place a towel or cloth object on the floor, grab the object with your toes, and pull it towards you. Hold the grasp for 30 seconds, switch feet and repeat.\\n3. v4-460px-Avoid-Heel-Pain-and-Plantar-Fasciitis-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\\n4. Overdoing physical activity takes its toll on your body, including your feet. Pace yourself during exercise. If you are starting a new sport or physical activity, increase your activity level gradually to avoid sudden strain on your muscles and abrupt added stress on your feet. Avoid foot injury from heavy landings from jumping. If jumping is involved in your sport or exercise routine, take care to provide shoes that provide the proper support.\\n5. v4-460px-Avoid-Heel-Pain-and-Plantar-Fasciitis-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n6. v4-460px-Avoid-Heel-Pain-and-Plantar-Fasciitis-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\\n7. v4-460px-Avoid-Heel-Pain-and-Plantar-Fasciitis-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n8. The plantar fascia is a ligament that consists of a thick band of tissue that runs from the heel bone to the toe area. The plantar fascia ligament provides support for the natural arch in your feet. Injury to the plantar fascia is the primary reason for heel pain.

This one can be hard, but as long as you let her take the lead you can help her get a hold of her feelings. Get her to open up about how she feels instead of the situation or the outcome by drawing on your personal experience.

I would be really let down in your shoes.\" \"You absolutely have a right to be sad; I would be too.\" \"I know you\\'re angry and upset right now. I understand, and it sucks.\"\\n5. At the end of the day, remember that you aren\\'t there to make things magically better, you\\'re there to support her.

Things not to say include:\\n\"You were too good for that job anyway. They\\'re not even worth your time.\" Clearly, since she\\'s upset, she thinks it was worth her time. \"I know exactly how you feel.\" Everyone\\'s problems are unique -- you don\\'t know exactly how she feels, and she\\'ll sense it. \"You\\'re so strong -- you\\'ll be fine.\" Sometimes people need some time not to be strong.

It can be easy to focus on all of the tasks that need to be done on a daily basis, rather than focusing on yourself and your feelings. Try taking multiple short breaks throughout the day. Taking a break from work will give you time to check in with yourself and see how you\\'re feeling. Every hour, give yourself a break of about 5 minutes. You can go get a drink of water, stretch, or just zone out for a few minutes. Taking a break is good for your mind and body. While you stretch, daydream about something fun you would like to do after work. This is an excellent mood boost.\\n4. Similarly, the process of getting to know yourself better should include spending some time thinking about things that do not make you happy. Again, some might be simple and obvious. For instance, no one likes being stuck in traffic. But take time to reflect on pieces of your life that might be significantly impacting your happiness. Make a list of the stressful components of your life. Often, putting things in writing can help us get a more clear view of the situation. Is your job stressing you out? Write down some specifics, such as \"I feel stressed because my boss does not seem to value me.\"\\n5. Being happy every day does not mean that you will be happy every moment. That is impossible and unrealistic. Instead, aim to become a person who is well-rounded emotionally. Once you are comfortable feeling a range of emotions, you will be better able to get in touch with how to be happy. Self-validation is the process of acknowledging your feelings and reactions. It is healthy to understand that everyone has a range of emotions, and it is normal to express them. Don\\'t put pressure on yourself to feel happy all the time.

The act of singing in church is considered a form of prayer. Focus on the fellowship. It is referenced within the Bible as being a way to praise God: \"Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord,\" Ephesians 5:19. What makes singing powerful is the positive feelings it can bring. \"Come let us sing for joy to the Lord,\" Psalms 95:1. Remember that you are singing for a community, which can be both comforting and empowering. There is nothing but love and support in the congregation. Search for a song that conveys your feelings of love, worship, and faith.

Typically, red wine vinegar is used to make biltong, but you can also use apple cider vinegar. Either option creates a tasty marinade that adds flavor to your biltong.\\n2. To create a rubbing mixture, mix together 125 g (8.3 tbsp) of crushed coriander seeds and 15 g (1 tbsp) of black pepper in a large-sized mixing bowl. In addition, pour in 30 g (2 tbsp) of salt, 100 g (6.7 tbsp) of brown sugar, and 15 g (1 tbsp) of baking soda. Use a spoon to mix it all together. This creates your rubbing mix, which adds additional flavors to your biltong. If you’d like, you can also use 14.8 g (1 tbsp) of paprika or chili flakes. The baking soda dries out the meat.\\n3. v4-460px-Make-Biltong-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n4. For best results, use high-quality cuts of beef, like silverside or topside. Use a sharp, serrated butcher's knife to cut your slab of meat into strips. You can also cut your meat into 20 cm (7.9 in) long slices.\\n5. Once your meat is completely covered in spices, leave the pieces in the bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. For best results, put the thicker pieces of meat at the bottom. Then, place the bowl inside your refrigerator for 12-24 hours. The longer you refrigerate the meat, the more flavorful the biltong will taste. If you’d like, you can stir up the meat every 3-4 hours so each side flavors evenly.

Set the circular saw to cut about ⁄16 in (1.1 cm) deep. This is the average size of wood siding panels, and cutting deeper can mean damaging the layers underneath it. Starting at the bottom of the panel, make vertical cuts up to the panel above it. These small, cut panels are easier to remove and you can easily separate damaged portions this way. You can use the saw or knife this way to cut out broken sections of siding. You can then replace the section without damaging other panels. Another way to do this is to cut horizontally about halfway up from the panel’s bottom end. If you’re replacing one piece of siding, use a reciprocating saw with a short wood blade.\\n1. Start with the lowest section of siding you wish to replace. Place it on the wall, making sure the bottom edge overlaps the panel beneath it. You will need to secure the panel in place first before hanging any panels above it. Overlap each row of panels by at least 1 in (2.5 cm). Use a level to ensure each panel is straight. Make sure any shims you used earlier are removed from the wall. You want the panels to lay flat against it. If you replace all of the siding, you have a little more leeway. As long as you keep the overlap consistent, your siding should look fine.\\n2. Galvanized nails are good for rust resistance. Place a nail in each of the holes you drilled and hammer it down. Each nail passes through the bottom of the overlapping board and the top of the board underneath it. You can also use exterior wood screws if you have a drill or screw gun.\\n3. v4-460px-Replace-Siding-Step-6.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Replace-Siding-Step-2.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Replace-Siding-Step-8.jpg\\n6. All of these items are important if you plan on cutting siding. Gloves and goggles are useful for protecting your hands and eyes from damage. The most important piece to remember is the respirator mask, which blocks harmful particles released when cutting siding. You can get all of the items from a home improvement store. Fiber cement is similar to wood siding and is installed the same way. However, the dust released when you cut it is toxic, so always wear your respirator!\\n7. v4-460px-Replace-Siding-Step-4.jpg\\n8. Slide a small, sharp hacksaw underneath the wedged panel. Carefully saw through the nails holding the piece of siding to the wall. The board should be loose now. You can test this by attempting to lift the board away from the wall by hand. To completely loosen a long piece of siding, you will need to move the shims to continue cutting stubborn nails.

Study the basic rules and regulations, as well as more advanced plays and theories, until you know them like the back of your hand. Whereas the duties of guiding the team fall to the coaching staff in most other sports, the captain of a cricket team is largely responsible for calling the shots. For this reason, it’s imperative that you have a good grasp of the intricacies of the sport. Chances are that you’re already quite familiar with the sport if you’re in the running for team captain (or hope to be soon). However, there’s always more to learn.

Watch your fellow players closely and make a note of where they play their best game. Not only is this essential for establishing the batting order, it will also allow you to implement winning tactics on the fly. For example, if your best bowler has a tendency to choke under pressure, knowing when to swap them out could mean the difference between a win and a loss. It’s also helpful to recognize when another player may have a better grasp of strategy than you do. If you’re not very good at putting together a backup plan when a play goes awry but one of your teammates is, asking them for their advice will be in everyone’s best interest.

Lighting is important for making your bedroom feel cozy and bright. Choose a set of matching lamps, and place one on your nightstand, with the other somewhere else in your room. If you have a second nightstand, you can place it there, or on the dresser. For a cozier feel, you can use string lights along your ceiling or hung between walls to give the room some ambient lighting. You can also add a brightly colored lamp shade for a pop of color that coordinates with your color scheme. For example, if you’re doing a rustic or farmhouse theme, look for a lamp with a wooden base and a brightly colored lampshade. Switching out an overhead light fixture in a bedroom for a softer lighting option can also help to make the room seem more relaxing and romantic.\\n1. Whether it’s rustic, farmhouse, modern, or something entirely different, pick a design style to help you choose furniture, paint colors, and décor. This will help to make the room look cohesive and intentional, rather than a mix of different styles. Sometimes, you can get inspiration from a painting, a piece of furniture, or a quilt that you really love. Then, you can make it a focal point of your new room. Try looking at design websites like Architectural Digest, Better Homes and Gardens, or HGTV for inspiration.

With your color scheme in mind, pick out a duvet or quilt, pillow shams and covers, and a few throw pillows for your bed. It’s best to keep the quilt or duvet a solid color or simple pattern, and add pops of color with pillows. You can even lay a throw blanket in a complementary color across the end of the bed to pull everything together. For example, for a farmhouse theme using white walls with accent colors of blue, and yellow, you could have a blue duvet with pale yellow throw pillows. To save money, choose quality sheets and less expensive throw pillows and blankets.\\n4. To add some fun pieces to your room, position a piece of art or a mirror on an empty wall, like the wall above your bed. If you don’t have space above your headboard, choose a wall that doesn’t have anything on it. Look for pieces of art that match your general theme or color scheme. This will help to pull the room together. Hanging up pictures of family and friends can also help to make a room seem cozier and more inviting.\\n5. Pick a main color to go on your walls, and remove all of the furniture from the room to repaint. Try to stick with your color scheme if you want to do multiple colors, and choose a shade that will complement many colors, even if your tastes change! If you want to add some interest to the room, paint one of the walls in your accent color to create depth! For a smaller room, you can pick brighter colors like light cream or white to make the room seem larger and brighter.

The standard deviation, σ{\\\\displaystyle \\\\sigma },, is the square root of the variance. Simply take the square roots of σx2{\\\\displaystyle \\\\sigma _{x},^{2},}, and σy2{\\\\displaystyle \\\\sigma _{y},^{2},}, to get their respective standard deviations. After calculations, the results are σx=0.456{\\\\displaystyle \\\\sigma _{x},=0.456}, σy=0.522{\\\\displaystyle \\\\sigma _{y},=0.522},. Note that these calculations have been rounded to three decimal places to ease later calculations. Keeping more decimal places in your calculations will make them more accurate.\\n1. Covariance represents the relationship between two moving variables. If the variable increase or decrease at the same times, they are positively correlated and the covariance is positive. If they move opposite of each other, however, the covariance is negative. Covariance is calculated using the following formula: σxy=∑n=1n(Xn−μx)×(Yn−μy)n−1{\\\\displaystyle \\\\sigma _{xy},={\\\\frac {\\\\sum _{n=1},^{n},(X_{n},-\\\\mu _{x},)\\\\times (Y_{n},-\\\\mu _{y},)},{n-1},},},. In the formula, Xn{\\\\displaystyle X_{n},}, and Yn{\\\\displaystyle Y_{n},}, represent the stock's return on each day in the period. The idea is to sum up the product of the differences  between the stock return and mean return for each day. For example, the part of the covariance formula for first day would be calculated as: (0.9−1.0)×(2.5−3.0){\\\\displaystyle (0.9-1.0)\\\\times (2.5-3.0)},. This would then be added to the result for the other four days then divided by 4 (5-1). This solves to 0.774{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {0.77},{4},},},, which is 0.1925. The covariance between returns on stock X and Y is 0.1925.\\n2. In order to calculate the correlation coefficient, you will need information on returns (daily price changes) for two stocks over the same period of time. Returns are calculated as the difference between the closing prices of the stock over two days of trading. For example, if a stock closed at $2.00 on Tuesday and $2.04 on Wednesday, this would represent a return of 2 percent. Stock price information can be gathered from market-tracking websites, such as Bloomberg and Yahoo! Finance. Organize your returns as a sequence when you have your data, recording the two stocks in question as stock X and stock Y to simplify your calculations. For example, your data for stock X might be 0.9, 1.3, 1.7, 0.4, 0.7 over five days, while the data for Y is 2.5, 3.5, 3.6, 3.1, 2.3. Correlation coefficients can vary or even switch signs over time (from positive to negative), so the period of time you choose is important. Short-term traders may be fine using 20 or 50 days' worth of data, but longer-term investors will want to use 150 or 250.\\n3. v4-460px-Calculate-Stock-Correlation-Coefficient-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Calculate-Stock-Correlation-Coefficient-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\", 'question_id': 1013104, 'answer_choices': [[2, 4, 3, 0, 1], [3, 2, 0, 4, 1], [0, 4, 3, 1, 2], [2, 3, 1, 4, 0]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10131120.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

Most halogen downlights fit into the power supply with small pegs or pins. Check the bottom of the existing bulb to see how the connectors should look, then use a ruler to check the size of the fitting as well as the size of the cut-out for the bulb. Be sure to reference this information as you’re shopping for LED bulbs. You may be able to find the size of the fitting printed somewhere on the socket. If your bulb has a twist-and-lock fitting with two prongs on the bottom, it’s most likely a 240-volt GU10 bulb, and generally has a 50mm fitting. These can usually be switched for LED bulbs without replacing any parts. If the bulb has 2 sharp pins and pushes into the fitting, it is likely a low-voltage MR11 or MR16 bulb. These 12-volt bulbs require a transformer if you’re using them in place of a halogen bulb.\\n1. v4-460px-Replace-Halogen-Downlights-with-Led-Step-2.jpg\\n2. Lumens measure the light output of a bulb, so this is the number you should match to ensure you get the same effect from your LED bulb as you did from the halogen bulb. Average halogen bulbs are between 650-700 lumens, but you may have different needs for customized lighting effects. If your downlights are used to light a workspace area, you will probably need higher lumens.

You can buy these separately or as a kit, but make sure that they both come from the same brand. Since each brand is a little different read the instructions on the package to find out exactly what proportions you should use. In most cases, however, expect to use a 1-to-1 ratio of powder to developer. If possible, choose a powder and developer that are safe to use on your scalp. Measure out enough developer to saturate your hair, like a hair mask. About 4 ounces (120 mL) of developer should be enough for shoulder-length hair. 20 volume developer is the safest and least damaging, but you can try a 30 volume developer instead if you feel confident bleaching your hair.

If you're not completely opposed to taking a standardized test, you can choose to take the ACT instead of the SAT. Most colleges will accept either, but there are many differences between the two. The SAT places more of an emphasis on vocabulary, while the ACT places more of an emphasis on science and advanced math. The questions on the ACT are generally more straightforward than the questions on the SAT. Your scores for the three sections of the SAT are looked at individually, while your score on the ACT is cumulative. This means if you are weak in one area, but strong in another, you may still be able to do well on the ACT. The writing portion of the ACT is optional, although many schools require it.

These types generally have regular and predictable variations. Cepheid variables have well-defined, stable periods and amplitudes. They oscillate between fixed maxima and minima, and take a fixed amount of time to do it. Cepheids can have periods between 1 and 50 days. They have something called a period-luminosity relationship: how long it takes to complete one cycle depends on the intrinsic brightness of the star. This makes it possible to calculate how far away the star is. RR Lyrae variables are similar to Cepheids, but they are dimmer, and have smaller periods and amplitudes. They follow a period-luminosity relationship in the infrared, not in visible light. Mira variables are red in colour, and have long periods, over 100 days, and very large variations. The maxima and minima also vary, so one cycle can be slightly brighter or dimmer than another. Mira variables are typically very dim, and need a telescope to see. Algol variables are a type of binary star. On occasion, the dimmer star eclipses the brighter one, causing the brightness to drop for a short period. Slow irregular variables, as the name suggests, vary slowly and irregularly. These stars don't have a period. They are typically large, red stars at the end of their life, which causes them to flicker irregularly.

If you are a constant snacker and tend to go for sugary treats like gummy worms, lollipops, or chocolate bars, substitute these for trail mix with dried fruit. Dried fruit by itself can cause bloating and discomfort. It is also stripped of a lot of fiber during the dehydration process.

After cutting your plank, you should be able to fold it in half and pull off the extra piece. Cut down each plank in the first row in this manner. For example, if you need to cut 1 inch (2.5 cm) from your 6 inch (15 cm) first row planks, they should all be 5 inches (13 cm) in width after cutting.\\n1. v4-460px-Install-NuCore-Flooring-Step-2.jpg\\n2. Grab the carpet by an edge against the wall and peel it back as much as possible. Afterwards, use a utility or carpet knife to slice it into manageable strips. Continue pulling the carpet back, cutting it up into smaller strips and rolling it up. Remove any carpet padding in the same manner and cut it up into strips that can easily be transported. Although NuCore can't be installed over carpet, it can be installed over even concrete, wood, vinyl, linoleum, and ceramic tile floors. Remove any remaining carpet tack strips and staples from the carpet pad when you're done. Slide a pry bar under the nails that secure the strips and lift them up. For staples, pull them up with pliers and use a flat-bladed screwdriver to pull them out.\\n3. v4-460px-Install-NuCore-Flooring-Step-4.jpg\\n4. Although NuCore is waterproof, the subfloor must still be moisture-free for a proper installation. Sweep the floor with a broom to gather any dust or dirt particles. For wet areas, use a dry mop to collect water and moisture. Use a digital contact moisture meter to check the floor's moisture. Tap the device's 2 points to the floor and ensure that the moisture level is not about 2.5%. Check that your subfloor is level to ⁄16 inch (0.48 cm) within a span of 10 feet (3.0 m). If it's not, you need to level it by using an electric sander followed by a leveling compound.\", 'question_id': 10136446, 'answer_choices': [[2, 1, 4, 3, 0], [4, 0, 3, 1, 2], [3, 4, 0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 3, 1, 4]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/101366.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Make-Oatmeal-Soap-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n1. You can use whatever moulds you like for this recipe. If you're making regular bar soap, you can get away with using a 9 x 4 inch baking pan. You can really use whatever shape you want though. If you use metal or plastic containers that aren't specifically made for soap, be sure to line them with wax paper or parchment paper before pouring your soap into them. This will make it much easier for you to remove the soap once it's cooled. Some soap-makers even line their professional soap moulds. This helps prevent the soap from getting stuck in the corners of rectangular and square moulds. If you're using moulds with more detailed shapes, you won't want to line them as this will obscure the design.\\n2. v4-460px-Make-Oatmeal-Soap-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Make-Oatmeal-Soap-Step-8.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Make-Oatmeal-Soap-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n5. Carefully remove the soap from its mould/pan/container. If applicable, cut the soap into bars. Use a sharp knife to make clean cuts.

If you used a spatula, you can apply the body butter directly to your skin or onto your fingertips. You may prefer to use a spatula so that the body butter doesn’t get under your nails and to avoid contaminating the container with bacteria that may be on your hands.

To apply for a Canadian SIN, visit the official government SIN website at https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin.html .\\n2. Non-residents will need to legally enter Canada before they can start working. Being a national security threat, violating international human rights, having a criminal record of certain crimes, having a health condition that’s dangerous to public health, or being unable to support yourself financially upon entering Canada are all reasons you may be found inadmissible. Visit the government immigration website of Canada at http://www.immigration.ca/grounds-for-inadmissibility/ for more information on your admissibility into the country.\\n3. v4-460px-Apply-for-a-Job-in-Canada-Step-4.jpeg', 'question_id': 10141146, 'answer_choices': [[1, 3, 2, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3], [2, 0, 1, 3], [0, 2, 3, 1]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1014120.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. A standard tuxedo jacket is a single or double breasted dinner jacket without tails. Browse online catalogs or visit a local menswear retailer to view the different styles. Double breasted jackets usually have four buttons, and can either have one or two buttons close the jacket. Single breasted jackets should close on only one button. You might find tuxedos that close on more buttons, but those are simply incorrect. Don\\'t wear a tailcoat unless you\\'re going to a White Tie event, which has a similar, yet more refined dress code.\\n1. v4-460px-1014120-4.jpg\\n2. The collar, or lapel, around edge of the tuxedo jacket is an important element to the look of the tux. Not only is the sheen of the fabric essential to creating the formal look of the tuxedo, the way the lapels are cut contribute to the look immensely. A shawl collar is the traditional choice for a tuxedo. Shawl collars are rounded and provide an elegant minimalist look. People with round faces or figures may want to avoid the shawl collar as it may over accentuate these features. A peak lapel has pointed corners that provide a flashy trim to your jacket. Peak lapels are good for men with a smaller frames to help the shoulders appear broader. Try to stay far from any notch lapels. You\\'ll see them popular in the 1920\\'s and now, but they aren\\'t a classic look, and they are less formal than the shawl collar or peaked lapel.\\n3. Tuxedo shirts vary in style, so it is important to know what will look good as well. The more informal option is to have a shirt with a pleated front, french cuffs, and a turndown collar (a collar like what is on most dress shirts). The pleated bosom can instead be piqué, a special kind of woven cotton. The shirt can close with studs, or it can close with regular buttons hidden by an extra piece of fabric over the shirt placket. The more formal shirt will have a high wing collar, and single cuffs. This shirt will usually have a piqué bosom that should be starched as stiff as a board. an alternative is to have pleats with this collar and cuff arrangement, just make sure the pleated bosom is ironed crisply, and the collar is very tall. Detachable wing collars can provide a nice crisp formal look. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.wikihow.com\\\\/images\\\\/thumb\\\\/b\\\\/b6\\\\/1014120-5.jpg\\\\/v4-460px-1014120-5.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.wikihow.com\\\\/images\\\\/thumb\\\\/b\\\\/b6\\\\/1014120-5.jpg\\\\/v4-760px-1014120-5.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\\\"mw-parser-output\\\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\\\"nofollow\\\\\" class=\\\\\"external text\\\\\" href=\\\\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/creativecommons.org\\\\/licenses\\\\/by-nc-sa\\\\/3.0\\\\/\\\\\">Creative Commons<\\\\/a><br>\\\\n<\\\\/p><p><br \\\\/>\\\\n<\\\\/p><\\\\/div>\"},\\n4. v4-460px-1014120-2.jpg', 'question_id': 1014120, 'answer_choices': [[0, 4, 3, 2, 1], [0, 4, 2, 1, 3], [0, 2, 4, 1, 3], [0, 4, 2, 3, 1]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10141503.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Report-Pet-Store-Neglect-Step-2.jpg\\n1.

If you get cable Internet services, check your bill for a modem charge. It will be about $10 a month. The cable company charges you to rent the little box plugged into your wall.

One of the most important decisions in the design of your jersey will be not only the color of the jerseys themselves but also of the print. If you are modeling after another team, you simply need to match what they use - purple and yellow if trying to match the Los Angeles Lakers, for example. Typically, white print is the cheapest and most common. If the color you pick for the jersey is too light of a color though, you might switch to a black print for the lettering. For most jersey designs, you just need two colors. If you are going to be creating a more elaborate design with multiple colors, consider consulting a color wheel to match your primary color to complementary colors.\\n2. If you want a special logo to go on the front of the jersey or some cool font effects, you can easily do this on your own with some inspiration from the internet. Search for some similar designs or ideas online, and then either on the computer or by hand, draw some variations to make it your own. Most local printing shops will be able to help you turn hand-drawn designs into the real thing. It will be a little harder to get an online shop to do the same. If you are skilled in Adobe products like Photoshop or Illustrator, or any other CAD (computer-aided drawing) software that can help you digitize your ideas, doing so yourself can help make sure you get the details down just how you want them.\\n3. v4-460px-Customize-Jerseys-Step-2.jpg\\n4.

The tog rating, which ranges from 1 to 18, is a measure of the overall thermal insulation provided by the duvet insert. The higher the number, the greater the insulation. A duvet insert with a lower tog may be more appropriate for summer, while an insert with a higher tog will provide more warmth in winter.\\n1. Fill power is a measure of the size of down clusters used, ranging from around 500 to 900. An insert with a higher fill power is lighter, fluffier, and less dense because of the larger clusters used, which provide better insulation than smaller clusters because they trap more air.

Down may be composed of whole down clusters, fibers, or plumules (small feathers). “Loft” may refer to the percentage of whole down clusters in the mix, and a higher loft makes the down more resilient and better at containing warmth.

Large tubs can be bought at garden centres if you are short of space or don't want to dig out a pond. If buying a tub, fibreglass containers will last longer than plastic ones but will also cost a lot more. Kingfishers have been recorded diving up to 1 metre (3.3 ft) to catch fish so make your pond or water feature deeper than that if you can.\\n3. Kingfishers like to hunt in clearings where there's less vegetation to obstruct their views of the water. The fewer shrubs and trees around, the more chance you have of attracting these birds to your garden.\\n4. Feed the fish daily and clean the tub or pond every week to keep the fish healthy. Make sure at least a quarter of the water surface is clear and visible to birds. Don't overcrowd your fish as this will prevent them getting enough oxygen to survive.

You should even avoid over-the-counter herbs like goat's rue or fenugreek, since some babies won't tolerate these well.\\n3. Some milk banks only accept donations, but there are a lot of them out there that will pay $1 or more per ounce of breast milk. Some milk banks only accept donations in person, but many of them are open to receiving frozen and shipped milk. Take some time to search for milk banks in your area to see if there is one you like.

If you got your chinchilla from a reputable breeder or a trusted store that sources from reputable breeders, ask them for a recommendation. Most breeders and many pet stores will have relationships with small animal veterinary practices in nearby areas and can give you a contact at a local clinic. This is your chance to ask them not just about what vets around you will take chinchillas, but how each one will care for a chinchilla. Take the time to ask about previous experiences the breeder has had taking chinchillas to that vet.\\n2. If you can’t get recommendations online or you and your chinchilla recently moved to a new area, look for online recommendations. Read reviews for small pet vets in your area.

A grooming table with a 2 by 3 ft (0.61 by 0.91 m) top is just the right size for a wheaten terrier, and can really save your back while grooming! You’ll also need a standard-width and a wide-tooth dog comb, and at least one brush. You can try a slicker brush, a pin brush, or both. Using a grooming table at home will also get the dog used to being on one, which may make them more comfortable at the groomer’s or the vet’s office.\\n1. Once you’ve combed through the initial tuft above one of their paws, grab a new tuft above it that includes some of the hair from the previous tuft. Comb through it a bit at a time as before. Work your way up the leg, then repeat the process on the dog’s other legs. Remember to keep offering praise to your dog while combing them.\\n2. Work your way up their tail, tuft by tuft. Then do your best to work through the hair in the pits under each of their leg joints. You’ll likely find lots of knots here, so work slowly and pick each knot out. Then gently comb through the belly hair, bit by bit.\\n3. Start at their back and brush down each side, then move on to the legs, face, tail, and abdomen. Use short, easy strokes, and place your other hand above where you’re brushing to reduce tugging. Basically, do this initial brushing in a similar fashion to how you’d brush a person’s hair. If you groom your dog at least every other day, you probably won’t come across many knots in the outer layers.

Since your color palette will mostly be made of neutrals, it’s also a good way to combine different colors with your outfit. Use jackets, sweaters, and shawls to add layers over your dress or shirt. Wear a shawl over your dress in the summer, or layer a sweater over a blouse in the colder months (you can even add a trenchcoat over the sweater, if desired).

Don't leave your house without your jacket—in the Victorian era, jackets were used to show sophistication. Closely-fitted jackets were in style for both men and women, so either buy fitted jackets or take your jacket to a tailor for adjustments.

Be sure to also keep the air conditioner’s drip pans and drain lines clean and dry so that mold does not grow in them. Pay special attention to your windows if you live in a humid area. Poorly insulated windows can pick up a great deal of condensation, which makes them very hospitable for mold, while open windows allow easy indoor access for mold spores from outside.\\n1. v4-460px-Reduce-Mold-Spores-in-the-Air-Step-2.jpg\\n2. Mold spores in the air are often directly caused by mold growing inside your home. By eliminating spots of visible mold, you will significantly reduce the amount of invisible mold spores in the air. To identify visible mold, look for fuzzy stains that are black, green, or white in color, in enclosed spaces and rooms with a lot of moisture, such as the basement. Use sprayable mold remover to kill mold on hard surfaces, such as glass or tile. For mold on surfaces that are more difficult to clean, such as drywall, consider seeking professional help.', 'question_id': 10149771, 'answer_choices': [[2, 1, 0], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 1, 0]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10150202.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

If your job entails making and taking calls throughout the day, there are Bluetooth headphones specifically made for that purpose. These are not for listening to music but rather for talking to people without the need of handling the phone itself. These headphones can be especially useful if you’re in the car because they allow you to talk hands-free. Bluetooth headphones designed for phone-calls also have a longer battery life with some providing as much as 10 hours of talk time in one sitting.\\n3. v4-460px-Choose-Bluetooth-Headphones-Step-4.jpg\\n4. There’s a slight difference between Bluetooth earbuds and Bluetooth headphones. Earbuds fit directly into your ear and weigh close to nothing. These are great if you simply want to get up and go out as they’re very easy travel with. However they generally have lower quality sound compared to over-the-ear headphones due to not being able to drown out as much outside noise. This decision should be based on whether you need mobility or not and if you think it’s worth the compromise.\\n5. Bluetooth headphones have the advantage of being wireless which can make carrying them that much easier. While the benefit of going wireless means less fumbling with cables and cords, Bluetooth headphones need to be charged on a regular basis. Furthermore, if you forget to pay attention to the battery life, it can run out during mid-use which can be frustrating so think about where and when you’ll be using them to inform your decision. If you’re working outside all day and want to listen to music in the meantime, pay close attention to the talk/music time labelled on the Bluetooth headphones to make sure it’ll last for as long as you need it to.

It is best to consult your vehicle's manual for the best placement on jack stands. However, it is typically the case that one jack point exists per wheel. Just be sure you are setting the jack on a solid and secure point on the frame as opposed to paneling. Jacking on the paneling will not be able to support the weight of the car and will cause damage to the paneling as well as cause the jack to fall. If you are unsure about jack points, check online for your model's manual or consult a mechanic. The more jack stands, the better. Adding breeze blocks as a failsafe can also help make sure that if the car does move enough to come off a stand, you are still going to be safe.\\n1. Accessing the rotors requires lifting the car with a jack, and lifting on an unlevel plane is very dangerous. You should place the car in park, turn off the vehicle and place tire blocks around all tires to prevent movement during jacking.\\n2. v4-460px-Clean-Rotors-Step-6.jpg\\n3. It is not until you can access the rotors that you can truly know the condition they are in. Often, rotors can experience “lateral brake run-out” in which the rotor wobbles and unevenly wears down. If the rotor has worn unevenly, it means the brake pads will not make contact evenly or as soon as expected. Although it may not be immediately apparent, over time it can be dangerous. Rotors are expected to last between 40,000-60,000 miles for typical use, so be open-minded to the idea that your rotors may be worn or past their days of good use. They might need replacing.\\n4. v4-460px-Clean-Rotors-Step-2.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Clean-Rotors-Step-4.jpg\\n6.

Some goggle brands make specific lens cleaning products and solutions. Only use a cleaning solution if necessary. Goggles can usually be sufficiently cleaned without a cleaning solution. This step is optional. If your goggles appear to have watermarks that are not coming off after using a cloth or goggle bag, a cleaning solution can be used on the outer lens. Spray the cleaning solution on the goggles and gently wipe the glasses with a microfiber cloth, a soft cloth, or your goggle bag. Some cleaning solutions are used as anti-fog protector. If you are having issues with your goggles fogging up, just spray an anti-fog cleaning solution on your goggles then wipe it off.

Find out if there is a professional team associated with the area you live in, or, if you attend a college, if your school has a football team. Learn which conference the teams you plan to watch are in, what teams they usually play against, and how their overall performance is judged at the end of the regular season. For example, if you live in North Carolina, you might begin by familiarizing yourself with the Carolina Panthers and the National Football Conference South division; or by learning more about prominent college football teams in the state, such as Duke University and UNC Chapel Hill. Teenagers may want to get started by watching their high school’s football team. Different leagues have different rules for how conference champions are determined, so make sure you familiarize yourself with each league’s particular rules if you plan to watch both professional and college football.\\n3. Familiarize yourself with the fundamental objects of the game, how to score, and how teams win. Learn the particular jargon used to describe these objects so you’re able to understand what’s going on during games. The objective for each team in a game of football is to score points against the other team, while preventing their opponents from scoring against them. A team can score by carrying the ball into a 10-yard-deep area on either side of the 100-yard-long field, known as the “endzone,” thereby scoring a “touchdown” and earning 6 points. The offense may also make another attempt to score immediately after a touchdown by either kicking a 1-point field goal or carrying the ball into the endzone again for 2 points. Teams can also score by kicking the ball between the posts of the Y-shaped field goal in the endzone; this is called “kicking a field goal.” Field goals are worth 3 points.\\n4. v4-460px-Follow-Football-Step-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10150604, 'answer_choices': [[2, 0, 4, 1, 3], [3, 0, 2, 4, 1], [3, 4, 2, 1, 0], [1, 4, 0, 3, 2]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10150606.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

Depending on how many posters you have, you may need to store one roll or many dozens of rolls. If you only have a few posters, storing them all inside a single roll will be fine. A single roll can be kept just about anywhere, but if you have many rolls, then obviously you’ll need a bigger storage area. Select or create an appropriate space where rolls won’t be damaged by:\\nMoisture. Heat or light. Pests such as ants and termites. Objects falling on them or against them.\\n1. v4-460px-Store-Posters-Step-2.jpg\\n2. You can easily find and order square poster-storage boxes online. These are designed for more efficient stacking. If you have a lot of posters to store, square poster-storage boxes can be stowed in a tidier way than cylindrical tubes.\\n3. This will stop any contaminants damaging your posters once they inside the tubes. However, do not use cleaning products containing chemicals which might also damage your posters.\\n4. v4-460px-Store-Posters-Step-8.jpg\\n5.

Replace any tubes which show signs of deterioration with new ones.\\n6. Apply these to each of your tubes and keep a note of which posters are stored in which tubes. You can either write the titles of posters directly onto these labels, or, use letters to designate each individual tube (for example, 'tube A', 'tube B', and so on) and then write numbers corresponding to poster titles. Write down poster titles, which tubes they're inside, and the numbers they correspond with in a separate ledger.\\n7. v4-460px-Store-Posters-Step-4.jpg\\n8. v4-460px-Store-Posters-Step-6.jpg\", 'question_id': 10150611, 'answer_choices': [[4, 2, 3, 7, 1, 8, 0, 5, 6], [4, 7, 5, 3, 8, 2, 6, 1, 0], [0, 1, 6, 7, 2, 8, 3, 4, 5], [0, 3, 8, 4, 7, 2, 5, 6, 1]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10150612.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Suede-Paint-a-Wall-Step-2.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Suede-Paint-a-Wall-Step-6.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Suede-Paint-a-Wall-Step-4.jpg\\n3. Paints come in a variety of different categories of “sheen” or “finish,” which differ in how much light they allow to reflect off a wall. For this project, you’ll need to buy paint that is specifically designed to have a suede finish. Although suede paint is not the most commonly used, you can generally find it at most hardware stores like Home Depot. Ralph Lauren and Valspar both also make their own versions of brushed suede paint. You can also create a suede finish on your wall by painting a coat of suede paint over a base coat of normal paint that will show through. If you choose to go this route, make sure you buy ordinary paint as well.\\n4. Remove any protrusions in the wall, and dust the wall from top to bottom to get rid of any dust or dirt before you begin painting. Use sandpaper or a sanding pole to sand the wall from floor to ceiling, focusing especially on areas you had to repair in the previous step. Don’t apply too much pressure during the sanding process, especially if you’re using a sanding pole, or else you may inadvertently damage the wall itself. Use a long-reach duster to remove any dust and debris from the wall, including any grit left over from the sanding process.\\n5. Place painter’s tape over moldings or other surfaces you don’t want to paint, pressing down on the tape with a putty knife to ensure no paint bleeds through to the surface below. Lay a tarp down on the floor where you’ll be working, and cover any furniture near the wall with painter’s plastic secured with tape.

Before overhauling your diet and eating habits, it\\'s a good idea to journal about where you currently are with your diet. Journaling is a great place to start because it gives you an insight into where your starting point is. It makes you realize your strengths and makes you aware of your weaknesses. A journal can also help you keep yourself accountable as you develop new, healthy eating habits. Keep track of all your food and beverages for at least one week. Try to be as accurate as you can when you\\'re tracking your food. Even a few bites while you prepare meals should be accounted for. Don\\'t forget to track how many ounces of clear, hydrating fluids you drink. This is an area that\\'s also an important part of healthy eating. After you\\'ve kept your journal for a few days, star or highlight areas where you think you could make changes. For example, you might notice you don\\'t drink enough water or typically skip breakfast. These are great areas where you can make healthy changes.\\n1. v4-460px-Die-with-Dignity-Step-1-Version-2.jpg\\n2.

To identify potential breeders in your area, search the websites of breeding organizations and seek the opinions of local vets and friends with pet rodents. Once you've identified potential breeders, visit their operations and observe for yourself how the rats are cared for. Make sure the conditions are sanitary and humane, and that the rats appear healthy and content. Like any other pet, a rat adopted from a responsible source is more likely to be healthy and happy. It’s preferable not to buy rats from a pet store. You’ll have no idea about how they were birthed or raised, or their ancestry.\\n1. As any homeowner with an unwanted infestation can attest, rats are social animals that like to live in groups. If you adopt only 1 rat, they will likely be lonely and depressed, which makes them less engaging and more susceptible to illness. The simplest option is to get 2 rats of the same gender. Females tend to be more friendly in general.

You'll begin to relax and it will be easier to exfoliate afterwards. After the polish dries, massage your hands and feet with lotion.\\n2. You can save money by making your own sugar or coffee scrub to rub off any dead skin cells and freshen up your skin. Using a mixture of natural ingredients such as sugar, canola oil, and essential oils is better for your skin than a commercial brand as well as cheaper.An easy, repeatable recipe combines 1 cup of sugar, about 1/3 of a cup of oil, and 20 drops of essential oil. These measurements can be tweaked depending on your preference for fragrance or oil content. Apply the mixture anywhere on your body such as your hands, feet, elbows, and face. You can substitute coffee grounds for sugar and coconut oil is another good moisturizer instead of canola oil. Citrus zest is a cheaper and equally potent ingredient to substitute for essential oils. Be cautious though because these ingredients can be abrasive if you have sensitive skin or pores.

Wearing a sweatshirt around your waist was a popular fad in the 90s. To put it on, flip the body of the sweatshirt around your back and tie both arms around your waist. People did this in case it got cold out, but oftentimes the sweaters remained on their waist. You can also do this with a flannel shirt or cardigan sweater. Pick a colored sweatshirt that matches the rest of the look to tie your outfit together.\\n1. In the 90s, many women wore bandannas as tank tops. To do this, fold the bandanna in half at the diagonal, and hold it to your chest. Then, tie it securely around your back. In addition, tube tops were popular options. Tube tops are sleeveless crop tops that only cover the bust region. If you don’t want to wear a bandanna on its own, look for a paisley printed tank that resembles a bandanna. Wear your tank with high-waist denim or trousers or with a pair of leggings, for example.\\n2. v4-460px-Dress-from-the-90s-Step-6.jpeg\\n3. Graphic T-shirts are popular 90s staples, and skateboard tees were especially trendy. Pick a T-shirt from brands like Blind, Toy Machine, Element, and Volcom for a skateworthy style. If you aren’t into skateboarding, go for a vintage band shirt instead, such as Nirvana or Alice in Chains. You can wear the T-shirt by itself or throw on a sweater or jacket, for instance.\\n4. Windbreakers were all the rage in the 90s! They are windproof, multicolored jackets that people wore with all sorts of outfits. Wear a T-shirt underneath the windbreaker, and choose to either leave it open or zip it up.

Tuning in to a gymnastics competition or episode of Dancing With the Stars can be a fun and engaging way to study the visual component of kinesiology.

The best way to flush any type of drug from your system is to keep your body very hydrated. Drink plenty water throughout the day. Over the course of several days, the water will dilute the concentration of drugs in your body, and frequent urination will help flush out any detectable sign of the drugs. For drugs that are stored in the fat cells of your body (e.g., cocaine and THC from marijuana), increasing your water consumption will not have a noticeable effect. Adult men should drink at least 15.5 cups (3.7 L) of water a day, and adult women should drink at least 11.5 cups (2.7 L) of water daily. If you’re drinking water to flush drugs out of your system, increase the amount of water you’re drinking daily by about 2–3 cups (0.47–0.71 L).\\n1. Alcohol binds most easily to cocaine and the THC in marijuana and helps the substances attach to the body’s fats. Once THC and cocaine are stored in fat cells, they’re difficult to remove from the body. Drinking alcohol—especially in large amounts—only worsens the problem. Alcohol can have negative effects on your body on its own and may also lower your inhibitions and result in you taking more of the drug you’re trying to flush out.\\n2. v4-460px-Get-Drugs-Out-of-Your-System-Step-2-Version-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10153176, 'answer_choices': [[1, 0, 2], [1, 0, 2], [0, 2, 1], [1, 2, 0]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10153214.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Read-a-Psychrometric-Chart-Step-4.jpg\\n1.

Unfinished wood must be sanded to make lacquer application more effective. If you're using sandpaper, line it along a block of wood and rub it with the grain of the wood.

Mice are social creatures and are most comfortable in pairs or groups. While most mice are satisfied to socialize with humans, some prefer being around other mice. If your pet mouse generally seems irritable and has a tendency to bite or scratch when picked up, try adopting a second mouse and keeping them in the same cage. It’s likely that the presence of a second mouse will calm down the first mouse, and decrease its aggression towards humans. While female mice do well when kept in a cage together, unneutered male mice do not. They tend to fight. You can have your male mice neutered to prevent this problem. If you keep male and female mice in a cage together, it’s very likely that they’ll have babies.\\n4.

For example, if you’ve taken a nap, watched a movie, or sat still reading for 2 or 3 hours, your joints are likely to be stiff and sore afterwards.\\n1. Joint pain is one of the most common symptoms of RA. If your joints feel tender, warm, or painful while you’re bending them, you may have RA. Rheumatoid joints fill with excessive fluid, which can cause a feeling of joint tenderness even when you’re not bending or using the joint. The inflammation caused by the buildup of fluid in the joint can eventually cause the bone and cartilage to deteriorate. The bones in the joint may end up grinding against each other instead of gliding smoothly, leading to damage, pain, and loss of function. Technically, joint pain is caused by the joint inflammation that occurs when your immune system attacks the lining of your joints. However, you can experience joint pain without visible joint inflammation.\\n2. v4-460px-Diagnose-Rheumatoid-Arthritis-Step-4.jpg\\n3. If your joints feel warm to the touch, this is most likely a sign of active ongoing inflammation. Swollen, hot joints can be a sign of RA. The skin covering rheumatoid joints also often turns red in color. Redness occurs in rheumatoid joints because the joint inflammation causes the small capillaries in the skin covering the joint to become dilated and fill with blood. It may be difficult to tell if your own joints are warm to the touch or not. So, to determine if your joints are warm, ask a friend or family member to rest their hand on your inflamed joints.\\n4. v4-460px-Diagnose-Rheumatoid-Arthritis-Step-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10159539, 'answer_choices': [[3, 2, 1, 4, 0], [4, 1, 0, 3, 2], [1, 4, 0, 2, 3], [2, 0, 3, 4, 1]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10159974.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Fix-a-Toxic-Relationship-Step-4.jpg\\n1. It’s tempting to want to fix the other person, especially if you care about them. However, you can’t change another person’s thoughts or behaviors, and trying will only make the situation worse. Instead, focus on yourself. Trying to change the other person will frustrate both you and them. Learning to control your reactions to the other person and to support your own emotions will have a bigger impact toward fixing your relationship.\\n2. You can’t control what the other person does, but you can control how you react to it. Choosing healthy coping skills can help you feel better and have better interactions with the other person. Here are some great options for healthy coping:\\n\\nMeditate to calm your mind. Take a bubble bath. Use essential oils or aromatherapy. Go for a walk. Do breathing exercises. Color in an adult coloring book. Spend time with your pet. Go out with friends.\\n3. v4-460px-Fix-a-Toxic-Relationship-Step-2.jpg\\n4. People in a toxic relationship often feel that they can’t be who they are, and may rely on the other person to fulfill certain needs. The best way to overcome that is to learn how to fulfill your own needs by focusing on what makes you happy. You’ll also improve your self-esteem, which will help you break the toxic cycle. Working on yourself will help you be a better, more stable partner. Even if the other person doesn’t change, your relationship will still improve. For example, you might enroll in a class, join a recreational sports team, or try out a new hobby that interests you.\\n5. v4-460px-Fix-a-Toxic-Relationship-Step-6.jpg', 'question_id': 10159974, 'answer_choices': [[1, 3, 4, 0, 2, 5], [1, 4, 3, 5, 0, 2], [2, 5, 0, 4, 1, 3], [4, 1, 2, 3, 0, 5]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10160194.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

This will prevent you from inadvertently selling the same tickets twice and having to cancel the deal through the resale site. Be sure you remove the listing from all resale websites you posted the tickets to.

Set a price for your tickets that is reflective of their value (e.g., a higher price for closer seats), but which will also encourage buyers to buy your tickets over others. Look for other tickets to your concert on resale websites to gauge how other sellers are pricing their tickets. These are the offers you will be competing with. For example, if your tickets originally cost $300 and other resellers are offering similar seats for $200, you should also set your price at around $200 to stay competitive. If you'd rather not deal with pricing yourself, many resale websites will offer to set the price for you or to automatically lower the price of your tickets as the concert date approaches to keep them competitive.\\n4. v4-460px-Sell-Concert-Tickets-Step-2.jpg\\n5. This is a great way of expanding the number of people who might consider buying your tickets to friends, family, and acquaintances. For instance, post a status on Facebook that directs people to your listing: “Hi friends! I have 2 tickets to the Childish Gambino concert next month up for sale on StubHub if anyone wants to take them off my hands!”\\nBe sure to include a link in your post to the site where people can purchase your tickets. If family members or local friends decide to buy your tickets, you will also be able to sell them in person instead of online, thereby avoiding having to pay any fees.\\n6. How quickly your tickets sell and how much you or your buyer have to pay in fees will vary from site to site. Choose a website or websites that best fit the circumstances of your sale. For example, if selling the tickets quickly is your top priority, you may want to use StubHub or TicketMaster, which have relatively high volumes of traffic. However, if you'd rather prioritize the amount of money you'll make, consider a site like TickPick, which charges smaller fees. If your tickets are for a jam band concert or music festival, you might want to try selling them on Cash or Trade, a site that specializes in buying and selling concert tickets for that genre of music.\", 'question_id': 10160213, 'answer_choices': [[4, 3, 6, 5, 2, 1, 0], [1, 2, 4, 0, 6, 3, 5], [6, 4, 3, 2, 5, 1, 0], [4, 0, 5, 2, 6, 3, 1]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1016029.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Buddy-Tape-an-Injured-Toe-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Buddy-Tape-an-Injured-Toe-Step-2-Version-4.jpg\\n2. Once you've decided on which two toes to tape together, grab some medical or surgical tape and loosely tape your injured toe to the uninjured one, perhaps using a figure-eight pattern for the most stability. Be careful not to tape too tightly, otherwise you'll create additional swelling and may even cut off blood circulation to the injured toe. Consider placing some cotton gauze between the toes to prevent skin abrasion and/or blisters. Your risk of bacterial infection significantly increases with blistering and abrasions. Don't use so much tape that you can't fit your foot into your shoes. Furthermore, too much tape promotes overheating and perspiration. Materials used for binding toes include medical / surgical paper tape, self-adherent wrap, electricians tape, small Velcro wraps and rubber bandages. To provide a little more support, which is certainly beneficial for dislocated toes, you can use a wooden or metal splint along with the tape. For toes, popsicle sticks work well, just make sure there are no sharp edges or splinters that can dig into the skin.\\n3. Toes are very susceptible to injury and even breaking when exposed to blunt trauma, such as stubbing them against furniture or kicking sports equipment around. In most cases, it's obvious which toe is injured, but sometimes you need to examine your toes closely to better understand the injury. Signs of mild-to-moderate injuries include redness, swelling, inflammation, localized pain, bruising, reduced motion, and maybe some degree of crookedness if the toe is dislocated or broken. The smallest toe (5th) and the great toe (1st) are injured and broken more often than the other toes. Buddy taping can be used on most toe injuries, even stress or hairline fractures, although more serious fractures typically need casting or surgery. Small hairline fractures, bone chips, contusions (bruises), and joint sprains are not considered serious problems, but severely crushed toes (mangled and bleeding) or displaced compound fractures (bleeding with bone sticking out of the skin) require immediate medical intervention, especially if the big toe is involved.\", 'question_id': 1016029, 'answer_choices': [[3, 1, 2, 0], [3, 1, 0, 2], [0, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3, 0]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10160330.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-459px-Make-Strawberries-Sweeter-Without-Sugar-Step-2.jpg\\n1. Choose high-quality chocolate. Heat 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water in a saucepan until it us simmering. Then, put 2 cups (12 ounces) of dark chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl and put the bowl into the saucepan so that the steam rises and heats the bottom of the bowl. Stir the chocolate chips gently as they gradually melt. Meanwhile, dry your strawberries thoroughly. The dryer the strawberry, the easier it will be for the chocolate to stick to it. Then, line a baking tray with parchment paper. Remove the bowl with the dark chocolate and place it on a pot holder beside your strawberries. Lift a strawberry by its stem then dip and swirl into the melted chocolate until it is coated. Lay the coated strawberry on the lined baking tray. Wait for the chocolate to set. You can leave them out in a cool dry place or if you want to speed the process along you can put them into a fridge. Once set, they're ready to eat!

Dried fruits and nuts have healthy preservatives within them that, when served with fresh fruit, can help draw out the sweetness. Additionally, eating nuts or dried fruit adds a good contrast to the fresher strawberry. Collect 1 ounce (28 g) of almonds, pecans, and walnuts then chop them into small pieces and sprinkle them over a bowl of chopped strawberries for a quick and nutritious snack.\\n4. v4-459px-Make-Strawberries-Sweeter-Without-Sugar-Step-4.jpg\\n5. Stevia is a naturally-occurring alternative to sugar that is growing in popularity since it is healthier than granulated sugar. The taste difference is marginal at best so if you're desperate for a sprinkling of sugar over your strawberries, Stevia is the healthier option. If you're looking for something that's easier to mix into a bowl, agave syrup is another naturally-occurring and tasty alternative that will sweeten strawberries. About 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of syrup would be a perfect amount to cover a handful of strawberries.

Most mozzarella cheese sticks will be about 1 ounce (28 g). If they are bigger than that, you can cut or tear them in half lengthwise. Don't use whole milk mozzarella cheese.

Avoid using a regular brush on your tangles, since this can tear your hair and cause damage. Always work through tangles with a wide-toothed comb, especially if you’re detangling wet hair. Start below the knot and gently work your way up until it is completely loosened. Go slowly and be patient. Vigorous combing can make tangles even worse. When combing tangled hair, always start at the ends and work your way up toward the roots. If you deal with tangles frequently, consider getting a detangling brush. They are specifically designed to painlessly remove knots from your hair. Detangling brushes are great for detangling dry hair, but wide-toothed combs are almost always the best option for detangling wet hair.\\n1. Detanglers are very effective products made specifically to help you remove tangles. Most of them are meant to be sprayed onto wet hair, making it much easier to get a wide-toothed comb through knotted wet locks. Most of these products offer other benefits, as well, such as hydrating the hair and making it look shiny. Different detanglers work better for different hair types. If you have straight hair, a detangling spray may be ideal for you. If you have wavy or curly hair, a detangling cream might be a better bet. Look for detangler formulas that include keratin. Also check the ingredients for moisturizing botanicals like aloe vera, sunflower seed oil, and grapefruit extract.\\n2. v4-460px-Fix-Tangled-Hair-Step-4-Version-5.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Fix-Tangled-Hair-Step-2-Version-5.jpg', 'question_id': 101613, 'answer_choices': [[2, 1, 0, 3], [0, 3, 1, 2], [1, 0, 3, 2], [0, 1, 3, 2]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10161408.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Paint-a-Car-Interior-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n1.

If you start trying to pull off steering wheel panels without knowing what you're doing, you could easily be injured by an unexpectedly-deployed airbag. Read your owner's manual in great detail before attempting to remove any steering wheel components for painting. Generally speaking, you should disconnect your car battery and wait at least 30 minutes before attempting to remove any steering wheel panels. After that, you may need to disconnect the airbag (possibly from the underside of the steering column) and remove the airbag chamber, cover and all, from the steering wheel.

In order to safely learn to sing lower notes, you will first need to find the lowest note you can currently sing. Either use a pre-recorded tool online or have a partner play notes on a piano. Starting from C4, try to sing that note. Work your way down until you reach a note you either cannot match at all or that you strain to sing. The previous note is the bottom of your current range. Because it can be difficult to judge our own voices accurately, it is especially helpful to have a vocal coach or someone else with musical training for this step. Or, use an app like SingScope if you need help.\\n2. Before going to the next lower note, it's important that you can consistently hit your new note.

Manx rats are particularly prone to overheating due to their lack of a tail. Place their cage somewhere cool that won’t get hotter than 90 °F (32 °C). Rats use their tails to release heat from their bodies, which makes tailless varieties like the Manx rat more likely to suffer from heat stress. Regulate their temperature closely. Keep your cage out of unheated rooms like garages or areas with a draught. Although Manx rats are most prone to overheating, they can also become very uncomfortable in chilly locations.\\n1. Rat droppings will pile up quickly inside your rat’s cage and will give off harmful amounts of ammonia in just a few days. Replace dirty bedding once a week and scrub the rest of the cage with warm soapy water. A strong odor coming from your rat’s cage means that it needs to be cleaned. If replacing the bedding and cleaning the cage once a week is not keeping odors away, you may need to clean the cage more regularly (e.g., twice a week instead of once a week).\\n2. Rats are intelligent and playful creatures, and will become bored or even depressed living in a cramped cage with no stimulation. Fill your cage with fun toys for your rat to play with. The minimum recommended size for a rat cage is 24 inches (61 cm) in length, 24 inches (61 cm) in width, and 14 inches (36 cm) in height. Wire cages are ideal for rats, as they allow rats to climb up the walls and provide good ventilation. Use a solid tray for the floor rather than wire. Make sure the top of the cage is secure; rats are very intelligent and are good at escaping from enclosures.\\n3. v4-460px-Care-for-a-Manx-Rat-Step-2.jpg\\n4.

Use the kit to gather water from the pool, and add the chemicals or test strip to the water. Then, wait for the strip or the water to change colors, and match the color to the label on the packaging of the kit. The calcium hardness should be around 250-350 parts per million (PPM). If the hardness is above 350 PPM, you will need to lower it. If the calcium levels in your pool are regularly above 350 PPM, do a calcium hardness test for your tap water.

Fresh lettuce is firm and crisp. As lettuce ages, it becomes soft, droopy, and wrinkled. You can spot these changes by eye or by touching the leaves. These leaves may not yet feel wet, but the lettuce is still near spoiling when it begins to wilt. Lettuce wilts right before it begins to turn brown. You will have to discard it or find a use for it right away. Wilted lettuce is safe to eat if it hasn’t begun rotting. You can try soaking it in ice water for up to 30 minutes, which may restore its crispness.\\n2. You won’t be able to smell or touch the lettuce until you open the bag, but you may still see some signs of spoilage. The bag will puff up as moisture escapes the leaves. You may see beads of water collecting on the inside of the bag. Moisture creates the perfect growing spot for bacteria and mold, so don’t eat the lettuce. You may be able to see brown spots in a spoiled bag of lettuce. You can also try opening the bag. The lettuce will have that nasty, rotten smell if it has gone bad.\\n3. v4-460px-Tell-if-Lettuce-Has-Gone-Bad-Step-2.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Tell-if-Lettuce-Has-Gone-Bad-Step-4.jpg\\n5. Discolorations are very recognizable when they appear. Normal lettuce is typically a light-green or yellow color, although varieties such as Red Coral have purple leaves. When the dark spots appear on multiple leaves in place of these colors, your lettuce is on its way out. Discolored lettuce often feels slimy and smells bad as well. Small brown spots usually aren’t harmful if you eat them. You can also cut around them if the rest of the lettuce leaf is still healthy.', 'question_id': 10163322, 'answer_choices': [[0, 5, 1, 4, 3, 2], [3, 1, 2, 4, 0, 5], [5, 3, 1, 4, 2, 0], [4, 1, 0, 2, 3, 5]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10163391.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Dark blue jeans look great with almost any type of top, and you can dress them up or dress them down. If you don't already own a great pair of jeans, find a pair! Look for darker washes, such as indigo. Also, try to find a pair of jeans that have a bit of stretch for a more flattering look. If you like jeans that are embellished, make sure to consider where the details are located. Jeans that have too much flash in certain areas can be unflattering. For example, if you are trying to minimize larger thighs, then a pair of jeans with gems or sequins along the thighs might have the opposite effect. Opt for high-waisted jeans to help smooth out your midsection. Avoid low-riders. The waistband of your jeans should also fit comfortably on you and it should not create extra bumps around your middle.\\n1. v4-460px-Dress-if-You%27re-Overweight-and-over-50-Step-4.jpg\\n2.

You can also get pantyhose that will provide all over shaping benefits for your legs, waist, hips, and thighs. Try on the shapewear before you buy it to ensure that it does what you want it to do.

A 2-piece suit is a must-have for anyone's wardrobe. It is a professional staple and you can also wear it on dates and to special events. You can dress a 2-piece suit up or down with different shirts and accessories. Make sure that the suit fits you well for the most slimming effect. Opt for darker colors as well, such as navy, black, or dark grey. A 2-piece suit can be expensive, so you might consider how much you will use it before buying. If you can wear it for your job, then it would likely be worth splurging on a high-end 2-piece suit.

Scoop up a small amount of soil using a shovel or similar tool. Do this from several different parts of the pond, including each of the far “corners” and the area near the center. Depending on the depth of your pond, you may be able to collect your samples from aboard a boat or dock. Otherwise, you’ll need to venture into a shallow section to dig out the soil manually. Rigging a device from a sounding pole and a tin can (or other narrow, sturdy container) can make it easier to take samples from the bottom of a particularly deep pond.\\n1. v4-460px-Lime-a-Pond-Step-4.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Lime-a-Pond-Step-2.jpg\\n3. Soil with a pH level lower than 6 is considered highly acidic, and can have a negative impact on fish, plants, and other wildlife. The primary purpose of applying lime is to minimize the harmful effects of overly acidic water by bringing it back to a more neutral level (around 7-7.5). If the soil from your pond tests out to just over 6, it will be up to you whether you want to go ahead and add lime or wait and test it again later. Don't wait longer than 3-4 months to re-test fresh soil samples from your pond. A lot can change in a few months where water quality is concerned.\\n4. v4-460px-Lime-a-Pond-Step-6.jpg\\n5.

It's a good idea to start with damp hair for this technique. If it's too wet, your product may not stick. If it's not wet enough, it's more difficult to create the wet look. Blow dry your hair or let it air dry until it's just damp. You can fake damp hair at times with pomade or gel. For dry hair, use a spray bottle to make it damp.

Fill one bucket or foot tub with warm water that's no more than 110 °F (43 °C), and another with cool water that's roughly 65 °F (18 °C). Submerge your feet in the cold water for 30 seconds, then move them to the warm water for 20 seconds. Keep alternating like this for 5 minutes. You can do contrast baths up to 3 times per day, whenever your arthritis is flaring up. The combination of warm and cold can help reduce stiffness, inflammation, and pain all at once.\\n1. Arthritic toes are often swollen or even misshapen due to inflammation, so make sure they're not crammed into a shoe that's too small. Choose shoes with a wide toe box to avoid putting pressure on your toes. Also, look for shoes that are comfortable to wear but have a stiffer sole, which will reduce flexing and pressure on your feet. Shoes that are too large might also cause discomfort, so aim for a roomy but comfortable fit. Don't wear heeled shoes, especially high heels. The shoes should have good arch support as well as stiffer soles, so choose athletic shoes over flip flops. Talk to your doctor about arthritic footwear specialists in your area.\\n2. Start by wiggling your toes for 15-30 seconds, then use your finger to lift each toe up (without causing substantial pain) for 15-30 seconds apiece. After that, tug each toe away from your foot, hold it for 10-15 seconds, then rotate it in a circular motion for 10-15 seconds. These are stretches that most people can do every day unless they cause substantial pain. If so, talk to your doctor. Arthritic pain in the feet is usually concentrated in the toes. If your pain is more widespread in your feet and ankles, talk to your doctor or a physical therapist about the best stretching exercises to do.\\n3. Capsaicin is the compound that gives chili peppers their heat, and, for unclear reasons, it seems to provide topical pain relief for many people when applied directly to the skin. However, you should buy a prepared capsaicin cream from a pharmacy instead of trying to make one yourself—too much capsaicin can cause significant skin discomfort. Follow the application instructions on the product and wear latex gloves so you don't accidentally rub any of the cream in your eyes.

Working for a reputable escort agency gives you a much stronger sense of safety and security than working on your own. Look online, talk to other escorts, or contact your local sex worker advocacy group for agency recommendations. Visit several different agencies and ask any questions you may have before you sign up so that you find one that suits you. Although the agency will take a portion of your income, the advantages of being safe, having your bookings handled, and having your clients screened first all outweigh the cost. A reputable agency will respect your limits and boundaries, provide a safe and hygienic working environment, and will be willing to answer any questions you may have. Reputable agencies will also provide security at the establishment. If possible, it can also help to talk to an escort who works there to get another perspective.\\n2. Escorts often do all of their own marketing and advertising. Use a search engine to find the escort websites that are prominent in your region or country. Sign up to the websites and then write up a short statement about yourself that's warm and approachable. Try to advertise with multiple escorting websites to increase your marketing reach. Some websites may require a physical description of yourself with different body measurements such as clothing size.

The first racket you test will give you a general idea of your grip size. Still, you may need to try out a few different rackets before you find a grip size that feels comfortable in your hand. The grip size are typically printed on the bottom of the racket handle, so use these numbers to help you find suitable rackets. U.S. grip sizes are measured by ⁄8 in (3.2 mm). European grip sizes are identical to U.S. grips but numbered 0 to 5. For example, a European size 0 is the same as 4 in (100 mm) in the U.S. Size 1 is 4 ⁄8 in (100 mm). Size 2 is 4 ⁄4 in (110 mm). Size 3 equals 4 ⁄8 in (110 mm). Size 4 is equivalent to 4 ⁄2 in (110 mm). Finally, size 5 is the same as 4 ⁄8 in (120 mm).\\n1.

Many professionals have taken to peppering their steak afterwards instead.\\n1. Cook on one side for 2 minutes, and then the other side for an additional 2 minutes. Flip using tongs, not a fork, as this will cause juices to leak out. Cooking the steak on each side for 2 minutes will give you a perfectly-cooked medium-rare steak. If you prefer your steak medium, then add an additional one minute cooking time to each side. That means cooking at 3 minutes per side instead of two.\\n2. v4-460px-Cook-a-Great-Tasting-Steak-Step-8.jpg\\n3. \\n4. v4-459px-Cook-a-Great-Tasting-Steak-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n5. Choosing the right kind of steak is a very important step that many people overlook. You\\'ll want a thicker cut of meat, at least an inch thick but hopefully thicker. You\\'ll also want to choose a piece of meat with good marbling, which means thin little veins of fat in between the meat. Finally, be aware of the cut of meat you get. Thicker is better. Why? A thinner steak is harder to cook well: Perfectly cooked on the outside often means overdone on the inside, because it\\'s so thin. But not just this. Your steak will shrink a bit as it\\'s cooked — the muscle fibers will tense up (like a balled fist) and some juices will be lost (although hopefully not too many). A thicker steak makes it easier to get a perfect crust on the outside and a juicy, pink center on the inside. Marbling is the amount of intramuscular fat in a piece of red meat. Cuts with good marbling are often tender, luscious, and more flavorful. Wagyu or Kobe beer, for example, are renowned across the world for their marbling and taste. Look for a cut of meat with good marbling on it for best results. It\\'s cost more, but it\\'s worth it for a great-tasting steak. What cut of meat are you going to spring for in your meal? This is a question that only you can answer. When you think of steak, you\\'re probably thinking \"ribeye,\" so that\\'s a great start. T-bone, porterhouse, sirloin, and strip steak are all great options, too.\\n6. v4-460px-Cook-a-Great-Tasting-Steak-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n7. You want your cast iron skillet to be really hot when you take it out so that it sears the steak quickly. For best results, leave in the oven for at least 20 minutes. Position the highest rack in your oven about 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) below the broiling range.\\n8. v4-459px-Cook-a-Great-Tasting-Steak-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n9. v4-459px-Cook-a-Great-Tasting-Steak-Step-10.jpg', 'question_id': 1016735, 'answer_choices': [[9, 3, 1, 8, 4, 5, 7, 0, 6, 2], [5, 8, 7, 6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 0, 9], [9, 0, 6, 1, 8, 2, 3, 4, 7, 5], [0, 7, 3, 5, 6, 1, 4, 8, 2, 9]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10167769.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

This train veers off from the route the other trains use. Instead, you can use it to go directly to stations at London Bridge, St. Pancras, and other locations northeast of Victoria. Thameslink trains run about four times an hour and the ride typically takes between 35 and 45 minutes, although your trip may take longer. It has several terminals in the Gatwick area, including inside the airport. The tickets for Thameslink trains are about £11 as of July 2018, although prices vary depending on when you travel. This train is a commuter train, so it can be crowded and leave you with little room for luggage.\\n2. The easyBus departs from the Gatwick Airport, as well as from other English airports, twice an hour. Think of this service as comparable to a budget airline. It is cheaper because it doesn’t have a lot of frills, such as many different stops or routes. The bus has no other stations in Gatwick and stops only in West Brompton, but you can then use the nearby Underground station to get to Central London. As of July 2018, tickets start at £7. Many times, you can get them even cheaper than that. Be wary of road traffic. The trips can take 90 minutes or more because of the busy roadways.

Wrap adhesive athletic tape around the leg just above or below the widest part of the calf. Then also wrap around the foot at the arch. Give each of these areas a couple wraps around so that the tape is secure and will be able to have further athletic tape applied to the top of them. It's important to make sure that these wraps do not restrict blood flow. Don't put any tension on them as you apply them but also make sure that they are not loose.\\n1. You don't want the tendon to be extended when you wrap it. This means that your foot should be slightly flexed, with all the pressure off the tendon. Typically, it's easiest to get in this position by laying on a table or bed face down with your feet hanging off the end. In this position, your feet will naturally fall into the correct position.\\n2. v4-460px-Wrap-an-Achilles-Tendon-Step-4.jpg\\n3. Cover the contact points of the vertical strips so that they are held with tape on the inside and the outside. This will help ensure that they won't move even when the ankle is flexed. You can also wrap the middle of the strips around the ankle, so that the vertical strips sit flush with the leg. When these strips are secure, they should take the brunt of the pressure when you step and flex your foot, minimizing the pressure put on the Achilles.\\n4. Since there are several ways to wrap an Achilles tendon, you need to decide between them based on your specific needs. In general, if you only have a minor injury to your Achilles, you are probably fine with just wrapping the Achilles in a compression bandage. If you have Achilles tendonitis or another painful condition, it may be necessary to use both athletic wrapping and a compression bandage. Both athletic tape and compression bandages can typically be found at pharmacies, big box stores, and from online retailers.\\n5. v4-460px-Wrap-an-Achilles-Tendon-Step-2.jpg\\n6. v4-460px-Wrap-an-Achilles-Tendon-Step-6.jpg\", 'question_id': 10168316, 'answer_choices': [[1, 3, 0, 6, 2, 5, 4], [4, 5, 1, 2, 0, 6, 3], [5, 3, 2, 1, 4, 0, 6], [2, 6, 3, 5, 1, 0, 4]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10168973.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Get-Rid-of-Bra-Bulge-or-Bra-Fat-Step-2.jpeg\\n1. If your breasts spill out of the cups at the tops or sides, then the cup measurement is too small. If the straps are cutting into your shoulders, then the cups or band size is off.

You can either buy a grooming comb made specifically for chinchillas or use a small dog comb. Start at the base of your chinchilla’s tail and make gentle sweeps with the comb, moving against the fur.

Don’t be alarmed if you see tufts of hair, instead of just single strands, being removed by the comb. This is especially normal during priming periods. Your goal should be to remove dull-colored dead hair. Hair that is still alive will have a bright white root section.\\n1. It’s important to talk with your vet before starting your chinchilla on any kind of supplement or medication. If your chinchilla suffers from repeated hairballs, your vet might suggest that they take a digestive supplement made with probiotic bacteria and vitamin C. These compounds are supposed to promote digestive health and help to break down hairballs. Read the medication’s directions carefully and consult your vet with any questions.

The Feldenkrais method involves working with a certified instructor to correct the way you stand, move, and use your body. Feldenkrais techniques may be helpful for improving your gait and the alignment and stability or your knees. Search online to find a Feldenkrais therapist near you, or ask your doctor or physical therapist to recommend one.

When you have knock knees, it’s important to stay fit and strengthen your leg muscles while minimizing the impact on your knees. Your doctor or physical therapist may recommend low-impact, joint friendly exercises such as biking, swimming, or walking. Additionally, talk to them about exercises that are specifically targeted to the knees but won’t increase your risk of injury or arthritis, such as:\\nSafety precaution: Always warm up for at least 5-10 minutes before exercising. This helps condition your body and prevent injury during exercise. Try warming up with some low-impact cardio, like walking or riding an elliptical machine. Doing alphabets with your toes\\nStanding kick-backs\\nWall squats\\nLeg lifts\\nStep-ups\\n4. Your doctor or physical therapist may recommend special shoes or braces that can help correct the alignment of your feet and knees. These devices can also take some of the pressure of your knees, preventing your knock knees from getting worse. Ask your doctor or physical therapist what kinds of devices will work best for you. Many people with knock knees have one leg that’s longer than the other. Orthotic shoes can help correct the difference, making it easier to walk and run without putting strain on your knees and feet. Additionally, orthotic shoes can prevent your feet from rolling inward as you walk. This is a common gait issue in people with knock knees. You may also benefit from a leg brace that supports the outside part of your knee joint.\\n5. v4-460px-Fix-Knock-Knees-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n6. Carrying extra body weight can put strain on your knees, making your knock knees worse. If you’re concerned about your weight and how it might be affecting your legs, talk to your doctor, a physical therapist, or a registered dietitian. They can recommend weight loss strategies that are safe and healthy for you. Your doctor will likely recommend a combination of diet modification and increased exercise to help you safely manage your weight.\\n7. There are a variety of yoga poses and exercises you can try to build strength, flexibility, and stability in your knees. Yoga is particularly helpful for treating knee problems when combined with physical therapy. Look for a qualified yoga therapist who has experience treating knee problems, or ask your doctor of physical therapist to recommend someone. They can teach you how to do the poses and exercises correctly so that you do not further injure your knees. Some good knee-strengthening poses include the Warrior poses and the Triangle pose. Iyengar-style yoga may be particularly helpful for treating knee issues related to knock knees, such as osteoarthritis and knee pain.

Most people will have a go-to comfort food they crave when they are ill, such as chicken noodle soup. Studies have shown that sick people crave chicken noodle soup because it contains a protein in the form of chicken, a hearty chicken broth full of vitamins, minerals, and some fat, noodles to keep you full, as well as vegetables like carrots, celery, and onion, which contain vitamins and antioxidants. In general, soups make good comfort foods for a sick person as they are warm, filling, and easy to digest. Avoid giving the person unhealthy foods high in trans fats and empty calories, as this will not support her immune system as she recovers from her illness. Nourishing foods like soup, porridge, oatmeal, and fruit smoothies are all good meal options for a person who is feeling ill and weak.\\n1. Another simple way to cheer up a sick person is to distract her from her illness by suggesting you both play a favorite game or watch a favorite movie or show together. Spending quality time with the person doing something easy and fun can make the sick person feel less weak and give her something else to focus on besides her illness. You can also bring their favorite novel for them to read to distract them from their illness and provide some entertainment for them. You can both also do a fun craft or a small project together that involves multiple visits to see the person. This will give the sick person something to look forward to and allow you to spend quality time more often with the person.\\n2. The sick person may have a high temperature and can feel chilled in a room that is too cold, or uncomfortable in a room that is too hot. As well, loud noises and a stuffy room can make the sick person feel worse, rather than better. Ensure the person is set up on a bed, couch, or comfy chair that is in a comfortable spot in the house and that a window is open to allow fresh air into the room. You can also make the person feel more comfortable by making sure they have access to warm blankets and lots of pillows, especially if they have a cold or a flu. A sick person may need to get up to 10 hours of rest. Encourage the person to rest when they are tired so that they can recuperate better.\\n3. v4-460px-Help-a-Sick-Person-Feel-Better-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Help-a-Sick-Person-Feel-Better-Step-4-Version-3.jpg', 'question_id': 101703, 'answer_choices': [[0, 3, 4, 1, 2], [3, 0, 1, 2, 4], [4, 1, 0, 3, 2], [2, 3, 0, 4, 1]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1017134.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

Many expats move with a job offer already lined up, and some countries require one as a requirement for a visa. But, if you don’t have any professional plans, try to learn about what industries are important in each country. You may be more employable in some places but not in others. If you have desirable technical skill that a country needs, like if you are a doctor or engineer looking to move to a developing country, you will be viewed as more valuable by a country’s government. Many countries are in need of English teachers. This is a great way to get your foot in the door and build a network of people who may be able to help you find another job.\\n1.

If within financial reason, try to visit the locations that you are interested in. Tour potential neighborhoods, observe how locals interact with one another, and try to picture yourself living there. Consider the proximity of potential living places to locations that you’ll need to frequent, like your workplace, schools, or grocery stores. Also assess how you feel in the climate.

Sometimes girls can feel lost when they are standing in a large crowd or even if she is standing amongst friends -- especially if her friends are attractive. She might think that some of her friends get more attention than she does because they are prettier or more outgoing, which means it can be difficult for her to feel like she is being seen and heard. So, make her feel like she is standing out from the others by giving her more attention. When she speaks, pay special attention. Make a point to talk to her directly instead of speaking to others.

Don't be put off if she refuses your gift. She may not want to immediately accept something from you. She doesn’t want to feel as if she is indebted to you because you gave her something.

Ask her if you're not sure. Understanding her interests helps you find common ground so that you have a reason to see and talk to her, which brings you one step closer to physically flirting with her. As you get to know her, be kind and considerate or she might not let you get much closer. Go slow. If you walk up and put your arm around a girl without knowing her well or flirting first, she might get offended and think you’re too forward.

After you have imported footage into the bins, start dragging them onto the 'timeline'. The timeline appears as a long horizontal bar that takes up the bottom half of the editing screen. The timeline is where the majority of the work will be done. Here, you can order, rearrange, and manipulate the footage in a variety of ways.\\n1. Once you've finished trimming, rearranging and importing all the footage you like, it's now time to export the video. The software collects all the edits you made of the clips and 'encodes' them into a friendly format. Sometimes exporting can be intimidating due to the sheer amount of options available to you in the software. If in doubt, always export at 24 frames per second (fps) and at 1080p. This means that you'll be able to play the final video in the media player of your choice. The quality will usually look better after the video is exported.\\n2. The name of the tool varies from program to program, but generally it's called the 'Trim' tool. You use this tool to trim the front or back of a clip to make it shorter or to extend it outwards.

It’s super important to make sure that all of your lines connect to one another. If you have any unconnected lines, color will spill out into places that you don’t want it during the manufacturing process. If you can, try to avoid small text or details on your designs, as it does not always translate well in manufacturing. Be sure to indicate if there are parts of your pin that you want cut out! Placing a red X over these areas is generally the way to indicate that these sections need cut out.\\n2. There are 2 types of enamel that you can use to make your pins: hard and soft. Hard enamel produces a polished, flat pin because the enamel is added before the plating, and each color has to be baked one by one. This means that they take more time and labor, so producing these pins is typically more expensive.\\n3. You can look to television shows, books, and movies for inspiration, featuring your favorite characters on your pins. Pins are a great medium for fanart. You can also think about combining fun lettering and icons. Keep a small sketchbook with you, so that whenever inspiration strikes you can quickly jot down your ideas. Online communities are great places to start if you’re looking for ideas. Possible starting points are the Facebook groups Pin Nation or PinTrades, or the Enamel Pins tumblr page.

Even if you\\'ve already paid off your mortgage, you\\'ll still pay for utilities, such as water and electricity, as well as property taxes.

Early on in your pepper plant’s life it may be easier to use your hand, rather than a pruner, to ‘pinch’ off unwanted stems and buds. Pinch the plant at the desired point between your finger and your thumbnail until you feel the stem break. Then gently and carefully remove the unwanted section of the plant. If you prune by hand, dip your fingers into a solution of powdered milk and water when moving between plants. The protein in the milk solution can deactivate viruses and bacteria that might otherwise spread between your different plants.\\n2. Nodes are sections of a stem where new leaves and stems can develop. If these areas look overly crowded, or underdeveloped, prune them back. While it may feel a bit harsh, limiting leaf production ensures that the leaves you do have left are fully developed. It also promotes further stem growth. If you are leaving very few leaves per node early on in the growing season, try to leave a few more as the season progresses. By the mid-to-late growing season, the stem structure should be fairly strong, and leaving additional leaves allows the plant to best use increasing levels of light.

There are a few natural remedies that you can make at home and use to remove the stain on your leather. If you want something that is fuss free and saves you a couple of dollars, you might want to try making your own stain remover before purchasing leather cleaning products. Add lemon juice and cream of tartar in a bowl and mix them together until you get a creamy paste consistency. This is a commonly used mixture that typically works to remove stains on leather without any trouble. Some may advise against using natural products because dye stains from jeans are often a lot more challenging to remove. However, it does not hurt to try especially if it does not cause any further damage to your leather.\\n1. Sometimes home made remedies and trusted products such as saddle soap might not do the trick. In such cases, try using some quality leather cleaner to remove the stain. Bear in mind that leather cleaner is not a magical product that will instantly remove the stain from your leather. Often you will get the best results by leaving the product in for a while before applying again. Try to use leather cleaner that is recommended by the manufacturer of your leather item.

The primer will help the stain or paint to stick better and last longer. Stir the primer before applying it on the tiles to make sure that it has not settled. Apply the primer in even coats using a roller brush, making smooth up and down strokes. Work through small sections at a time until you have covered the entire area. Allow 2 to 4 hours for the initial coat of primer to dry before applying another coat using the same procedure. Try to find a primer that also has protective properties for your ceramic tiles.

Australia has a universal healthcare system funded by the government. This is not the case in many countries around the world, including the USA. Most of these countries have insurance schemes instead that you will need to buy into for coverage. Many employers will offer a healthcare package as part of your contract where you and your employer both contribute to the cost. If this is the case, investigate the terms of this such as: how much it will cost you, when it begins, and how much it covers.\\n1. Once you arrive in your chosen country, there are limits on what the Australian government can do to help you if your work conditions are not as expected.

Different colors are better suited for particular engagements, jobs, etc. If you have a high-level business position, you will want to wear a different color than if you are participating in a casual, social gathering. For a job interview, the traditional choices are conservative colors. White is the preferred color among business types. Off white, light gray, or light blue are also safe colors to choose from. First impressions at job interviews are key, so you will want to look professional without making a \"splash.\" If you are looking to project a more lively image at a party or bar, choose bright or unconventional colors. Bright greens and oranges are relatively popular, as is pink. While you might not want to turn off the people you are hanging out with, you do want to stand out among the crowd.

If you are shopping at a retailer, most salespeople can help you find your neck size and sleeve length by using measuring tape. The chart below displays a guideline for common neck sizes and approximate sleeve lengths, determined by normal shirt size. If you have your own soft, fabric measuring ruler, you can measure the length of your sleeves and size of your neck before you go in to buy a shirt. It is generally better to do this with a friend or relative. To measure your neck size, stand upright. Have a friend pull the measuring tape around your neck at the level of your Adam\\'s apple (make sure your friend does not choke you). Your friend, or yourself, should be able to fit two fingers comfortably between your neck and the measuring tape. Write down the number in inches, as most clothing stores uses inches as a standard measuring formula. To measure your sleeve length, stand upright. Place your hand on your hip, so that your elbow/arm is bent at a 90 degree angle. Have a friend measure from the center back of your neck, down your shoulder, along the arm, all the down to your wrist. Write this number down in inches as well.

The weave of a dress shirt is a combination of thickness in thread, and how tight those threads are woven together. The four major types of weaves are broadcloth, oxford, pinpoint, and twill. These can be hard to detect by yourself without a professional. If you have a magnifying glass, you will be able to see the weave stitch. Otherwise, ask a professional to tell you what the weave of a particular shirt is. Broadcloth shirts have thin yarn woven tightly together. These are smooth in texture and have a crisp appearance. Broadcloth shirts are generally worn at professional gatherings, and at high-level places of business. Oxford shirts have a \"basket\" weave; one where the yarns are woven vertically and horizontally, crossing one another. These shirts are generally cheaper because of the yarn that is used. Oxford shirts can be used in more formal settings, or going to a semi-formal party/gathering. Pinpoint shirts also use a \"basket\" weave but are woven together with finer yarn than oxford shirts. These shirts are generally heavier that broadcloth shirts. These can be used for both formal settings, and going out to bars/dinner. Twill shirts have a \"diagonal ribbing\" pattern. These shirts are softer and yet heavier to the touch. They wrinkle less than most other shirts, but are hard to get stains out of. Twill shirts can be used for both formal and informal gatherings\\n6. The two major types of collars are point (standard) and spread collars. Each of these collars creates a different effect, and are designed for different shaped bodies. A standard point collar is the most common type of collar (95%) where the collar edges point downward at a 60 degree angle, and there is little space between the section where the collar meets. Standard collars are designed to help elongate a face that is more rounded, drawing the viewer\\'s eyes downward. A spread collar is a bit more modern and is considered by some to be youthful and lively. The points of the collar have been \"cut away,\" the collars point downward at 90 degree angles, and there is more space between the section where the collar meets. This collar keeps the viewer\\'s eyes on the face of the person wearing the shirt. Persons with longer faces can use this collar to create the effect of having a more rounded face. If you want to showcase more of the upper part of your tie, spread collars are a great option. The \"hipster\" look also takes advantage of the spread collar. However, most standard department stores only carry the standard collar. If you want to buy a shirt with a spread collar, look for stores that function solely as clothing stores such as J.Crew and Men\\'s Warehouse.', 'question_id': 101746, 'answer_choices': [[1, 2, 6, 0, 5, 3, 4], [5, 1, 4, 3, 0, 2, 6], [4, 0, 6, 5, 1, 3, 2], [2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 3, 0]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1017472.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Find-Suitable-RV-Camping-Clubs-in-the-USA-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n1.

You can spend time together without expectations of talking, and then you have a shared topic to discuss afterward that will put less pressure on you to find neutral topics.\\n4. Your friend may miss you as much as you miss them, but one of you has to be the first to share those feelings. Talk to your friend about how much you miss them, and assure them that they are a core part of your life. Say, “You’re like a sister to me, so not having you around is like losing part of my family.”\\nIf your friend has been spending a lot of time with a new friend or partner, let them know that you want some of their time, too. Explain that you understand that the new person is important to them and stress that you aren’t trying to drive them apart. Say, “I’m glad you found someone who makes you happy. I just miss hanging out with you.”\\nBe honest with your friend, even if you feel embarrassed. You could say, “It’s been really hard for me lately because you’re my best friend. I’m used to being able to talk to you everyday, but lately I’ve felt like you were too busy for me.”\\n5. v4-460px-Get-Your-Best-Friend-Back-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n6. If you’ve done something wrong, apologizing is the first step to healing your friendship. Simply saying “I’m sorry” usually isn’t enough. You need to be detailed and specific. Even if you don’t think the fight was your fault, you might have to take the high road and be the first to apologize. Show them that you know what you did and why it was wrong. Say, “I’m sorry for forgetting your birthday. I know that must have really hurt you because I would have been heartbroken if you’d forgotten mine.”', 'question_id': 101756, 'answer_choices': [[2, 5, 3, 4, 0, 1, 6], [1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 0, 5], [3, 4, 5, 2, 0, 1, 6], [4, 2, 6, 1, 0, 5, 3]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10175741.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

To get an accurate draw measurement, the most important factor is knowing how you will be drawing the bow to shoot in practice. If you have bad form, posture, or instruction, your draw length could come out several inches off from where it needs to be. A common issue with form is overstretching. It feels somewhat intuitive to stretch your arms and shoulders back as far as you can thinking this will translate into more power. However, beyond a certain point, you are not stretching in the direction of the arrow. This creates extra slack length that does nothing for your shot. Generally, you want your front arm outstretched and locked. Your back arm should draw the curve between the index finger and thumb to your jaw bone below the ear. This anchoring point will give consistent shooting and proper placement for aiming.\\n2. v4-460px-Measure-Draw-Length-for-a-Bow-Step-2.jpg\\n3. The nock point is where the arrow nestles on the string—not the end of the arrow. The pivot point is where the bow nestles into the curve between your index finger and thumb.

Sometimes, our minds become flooded with thoughts that, in retrospects, aren\\'t very important. Perhaps you lost your job, or maybe your girlfriend just broke up with you. While definitely important, these things are by no means the end of the world. Remind your brain of all the truly important things that it has going for it:\\nFriends and family\\nHealth and safety\\nFood and shelter\\nOpportunity and freedom\\n2. If your mind is a tangled mess of thoughts, it can help to write them down. Start off writing in free-form: record how you\\'re feeling, why you\\'re feeling, and what you want to do about it. After recording this information, you\\'ll have something concrete to reflect upon; this will help you feel a sense of accomplishment, even if you haven\\'t \"done\" anything. This really interesting trick will help you literally throw away your thoughts. Write all your troubles down on a piece of paper, discussing why they\\'re bothering you. Then crumble it up and throw it away. Yes, throw it away! Researchers found that people who threw away their written concerns were less likely to be worried by them.\\n3. Maybe you\\'re the kind of person who keeps their thoughts and emotions bubbled up inside. That\\'s not a bad a thing, necessarily, but it means that small concerns can quickly snowball into seemingly big ones overnight. In order to free your mind of worries you may be having — worries about love, stress about health, doubts about your job — learn to talk to someone. Reach out to friends and family first. Your friends and family love you and understand you. They don\\'t need rationalizations, and they won\\'t sugarcoat advice. Tell them about what you\\'re going through and listen for advice. If your friends and family aren\\'t the kind to lean a helping hand, consider talking to a therapist. A therapist is trained to listen to your particular concerns and find solutions based on calculated research and troves of experience. Don\\'t feel like you\\'re inferior for seeking the advice of a therapist. Have a deep conversation with someone. Easier said than done — but totally worthwhile. Researchers have found that having deep conversations, in which you go beyond the superficial and share something thought-provoking or intimate, actually makes people happier.\\n4. v4-460px-Clear-Your-Mind-Step-2-Version-3.jpg', 'question_id': 1017643, 'answer_choices': [[2, 4, 3, 0, 1], [3, 2, 4, 1, 0], [3, 2, 1, 0, 4], [4, 2, 3, 1, 0]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1017656.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. If you’re no longer vomiting (or your symptoms never included vomiting), then you can start taking advantage of the BRAT diet-bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast.

Knowing what not to eat can be just as important as knowing what to eat. In general, you should avoid greasy, spicy, or sweet foods, as well as those high in fiber. Milk and other dairy products can also be difficult for some people to digest while experiencing diarrhea. Also avoid:\\nGum with sorbitol. Sorbitol is a laxative.

When you have diarrhea, your body sheds fluids that contain needed vitamins and minerals. It is important to get those minerals back in fluids, especially water and sports drinks. Combatting dehydration is your primary medical concern with diarrhea. If you are vomiting in addition to having diarrhea, be sure to take frequent, small sips of liquid instead of drinking lots of liquid at a time. Other liquids that you can consume to combat dehydration include chicken or beef broth, flavored mineral waters, or rehydration solutions such as Pedialyte. Caffeine-free liquids are best. Caffeine is a mild diuretic, meaning that it can have a dehydrating effect. If suffering from diarrhea, stick to liquids that don't have the possibility of dehydrating you even more.\\n5. Roughly twenty-four to forty-eight hours after your symptoms have subsided, you can return to your normal diet. Reintroduce foods slowly to see the best result. Use common sense.

In most math programs, the subject that comes just before calculus is trigonometry. Trigonometry is based on the ratios of the sides of right triangles, particularly in connection with the unit circle. Trigonometric functions relate very well to describing motion, and calculus is based on measuring rates of change. Therefore, trigonometry is a key building block of calculus. In particular, you need to learn the following topics very thoroughly:\\nBasic trigonometry functions: sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, cotangent\\nInverse trigonometry functions: arcsine, arccosine, arctangent\\nKnow substitute functions.

If you know, as a young student, that you will want to take calculus, either in high school or later in college, you should start with your class schedule. Tell your guidance counselor that you want to get into calculus and map out a schedule that will do this for you. You will need to take at least the basic preliminary classes of Algebra (sometimes taught in one or two years), Geometry, and Trigonometry (sometimes labeled as “Pre-Calculus”). If your school offers different academic levels of math classes, such as basic, standard, honors, or so on, you should try to get into the highest level that you can.\\n3. v4-460px-Do-Well-in-Calculus-Step-2-Version-2.jpg', 'question_id': 1017657, 'answer_choices': [[2, 1, 0, 3], [2, 3, 1, 0], [1, 0, 3, 2], [0, 1, 2, 3]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/101767.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

A big part of your credit score is the percentage of credit available to you that you actually use. Generally, keep this utilization ratio under 30 percent for a good credit score. If you have a higher utilization ratio, you might want to call your credit card companies and ask if they'll increase your credit limit. However, the better option is simply to pay down those balances. Your chances of getting a lower interest rate will greatly improve if you have a low utilization rate. You will not look like you're requesting a lower interest rate out of desperation, or because you're over-extended.\\n4. Late payments not only result in additional fees, they go on your credit report. Too many late payments can have a negative impact on your score. Credit card companies will be less likely to lower your interest rate if you have a spotty payment history. Set reminders on your computer or smart phone so you don't forget to make payments. You can also set up automatic payments, so you don't have to worry about it. Include any automatic payments in your budget.

It’s easier for students to understand division if they can imagine a set of items being divided equally amongst a group. While 10/5 might seem confusing, giving out 10 cookies to 5 friends makes it seem simple! If you’re teaching your own child, you can introduce division by having them help you divide items into goody bags or separate baked goods into sandwich bags to hand out to friends. In a classroom setting, students can work in groups to divide a number of items, such as candies or plastic bears, evenly among themselves. Most students begin to learn division in the 3rd grade or around the age of 8 or 9.\\n1. v4-460px-Teach-Division-Step-4.jpg\\n2. Provide your student with simple math problems consisting of numbers that divide evenly. Remind your student that division effectively creates smaller groups out of a larger sum. You can work backwards from multiplication tables. For example, when dividing by 3, the math problems would include 3/3, 6/3, 9/3, 12/3, 15/3, etc. At this point, make sure the numbers divide evenly. You can download free worksheets for your student to use for practice by searching online for \"division worksheets.\" Choose worksheets for beginners. You can also create your own worksheets. For beginners, focus on numerical problems. However, they may benefit from illustrations or context. For example, you might make a worksheet about dividing pizza for a party. The context is that the student must divide certain numbers of pizza slices per varying numbers of guests, but the math problems will contain just numbers, such as 12/3, 12/4, 24/8, etc.\\n3. This seems simple, but it’s an easy step to overlook. Before your student can start working through problems on paper, they need to know the symbols they’ll use. For example, 10 divided by 5 can be written like this: 10/5 or 10÷5. Show them every way that the problem can be written.\\n4. v4-460px-Teach-Division-Step-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10177828, 'answer_choices': [[2, 1, 3, 4, 0], [0, 4, 3, 1, 2], [1, 3, 4, 2, 0], [4, 3, 0, 1, 2]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10177829.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Attract-Cats-Step-2.jpg\\n1.

Anxiety may lead a person to put a lot of faith in one specific medication if it worked before. They may be afraid of trying new prescriptions. They will likely show nervous body language due to fear of inadequate medication or general anxiety about needing medical help. Autistic people and those with ADHD may fidget, speak in a monotone or singsong, avoid eye contact, and act in ways that usually signal lying in neurotypicals. They may act nervous or hesitant to trust you because they are used to not being believed. Delusions and psychosis can lead to very strange behavior.

You may be able to spot uneven furniture simply by looking at it. If you are unsure or need to figure out which side is higher, set a bubble level on top of your furniture.

The bubble will stay in the center of the fluid once the furniture is even.\\n1. Look for small, rounded pads screwed into the bottom of your furniture’s feet. The screws allow you to level the furniture easily by lifting up the leg you wish to adjust. Turn the foot pad clockwise to raise the leg and counterclockwise to lower it.

Even though centimeters are metric units and feet are imperial units, you can still convert between the two. Centimeters are smaller units than feet, so you'll have more cubic centimeters than cubic feet. Start with the volume in cubic centimeters and divide it by 28,316.85. For example, if the volume of your shape or space is 500,000 cubic inches, divide 500,000 by 28,316.85. This is equal to 17.6573312356, which can be rounded to 17.66 cubic feet.\\n3. If you measured your shape or space in inches or were provided with units in inches, it's easy to convert them to feet. Keep in mind that inches are smaller units, so there will be fewer cubic feet than cubic inches. Simply take the volume in cubic inches and divide it by 1,728.

Place your measuring tape at the top of your shoulder and extend it down the front of your chest. Stop measuring wherever you would like the jacket to end. Jacket length varies based on height and the style of the jacket. For a standard blazer or coat, a good rule of thumb is to measure down to the top of the thigh.

Choose 1 strength that you will primarily focus on. This strength should clearly align with the desires of the company or qualifications for the position. Be prepared with 2 more strengths in case the interviewer asks for more. For instance, if you are applying for a teaching position, adaptability would be a good strength to mention. Education and curriculum is always changing; students have different personalities, learning styles, and needs; and schools vary widely in terms of procedures and programs. Being able to adapt is huge in this field. Other strengths could be good time-management or problem-solving skills, and patience.

Before you even go to the bank or look for other sources of financing, it's vital to have a business plan drawn up and thoroughly ready. It's your source of convincing others that this project is a go-ahead. As part of developing your business plan, address all previous steps in this part, including your own experience, your competition, the state of the market, your funding needs, and your planned routes. You also need to spell out:\\nYour cruise line's name. This should differentiate you from your competition in the same way that your offerings do. Make sure that your name reflects the type of cruise line you are starting. The activities you plan to provide on your cruise. For example, whale-sighting cruising, on-board activities, visiting cities or islands, etc. Your pricing structure. Remember that cruise lines profit primarily from on-board purchases like food and alcohol, rather than from the ticket sales. For a starting point, the average price of a cruise ticket in 2015 was $1,350, while customers spent an average of $429 on on-board purchases. However, much of the ticket price is eaten up by overhead expenses, like crew and fuel costs. Earnings and growth projections.\\n2. You don't need to have worked in the boating industry to start a cruise line, but doing well will require an intimate knowledge of this industry and the inner working of cruise ships. You may be able to gain a good amount of experience by being a cruise planner (like a travel agent for cruises) or a high-ranking employee aboard another cruise ship. For example, working as a captain, entertainment coordinator, guest services manager, or another important position aboard another ship would be good preparation for starting your own line.\\n3. v4-460px-Study-for-an-Accounting-Exam-Step-6.jpg\\n4. Learn about the industry and your competitors so that you can outline an unfulfilled niche for your cruise line to fill. This is the only way you can be profitable, as the cruise industry is highly competitive. What will be different or unique about your cruise line that will attract paying customers? Think about offering very luxurious travel, unique experiences or entertainment, or going to unusual locations as a way to differentiate yourself. Avoid taking on the large players, like Carnival and Royal Caribbean, directly, as these are powerful and established companies. However, there are a number of smaller companies that serve under 10,000 passenger per year. You could compete against these companies more easily than you could against the larger ones.\\n5. When starting a cruise line, your primary expense will be purchasing or building your ships. The cost will depend on what size cruise line you are considering. This can vary from a small fleet of one or two small cruise boats that can take just a small group right up to a full-size liner. For most people, a sensible beginning is a small cruise boat with room for a small group or family. This will allow you to build up your business over time and prove to yourself and others that it can work. The cost of this type of small boat depends on its size and features, but even a small cruise ship with 100 berths will cost about $50 million. A full-sized cruise ship, like those used by Royal Caribbean and Carnival, will cost you at least $150 million (for the smallest ship class). The largest ships currently on the water cost a whopping $1.2 billion. Your cost will also depend on your specific ship needs. Are you fine with customizing an existing one, or do you need to have a boat or ship built from scratch? Obviously customizing or buying a ready-made cruise boat will cost less than commissioning one from scratch. You will also need operating capital to buy fuel, pay dock fees, pay employees, stock the ship with supplies, and for other ongoing expenses.\\n6. v4-460px-Become-a-Cruise-Ship-Captain-Step-4.jpg\", 'question_id': 1018372, 'answer_choices': [[2, 6, 4, 0, 5, 3, 1], [0, 5, 1, 2, 4, 3, 6], [3, 5, 2, 6, 0, 4, 1], [6, 4, 1, 0, 3, 5, 2]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1018427.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. If you wrapped it tightly enough you can also tuck the ends of the strip into the wrap around your ankle. Use 3-4 pieces of 1-1/4 inch athletic tape to keep the pre-wrap in place.

Walnuts may be the closest thing to a single “superfood” for reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. They contain several categories of polyphenols as well as Omega-3s, so eating at least 1 oz (28 g) of walnuts per day may provide a great boost to your cytokine-reduction goal. 1 oz (28 g) is considered a standard serving of walnuts, but eating 2 oz (57 g) per day may be even more beneficial. You can also use walnut oil in your cooking.\\n3. All plant-based foods contain polyphenols, a class of compounds that decreases your body’s activation of the protein complex NF-kB, which in turn reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In short, then, eating a diet that is primarily plant-based can reduce chronic inflammation and your chances of developing numerous diseases. You don’t necessarily have to give up animal-based foods, but you should focus on lean proteins like fish and poultry and limit your intake of red meat and full-fat dairy products. Eating a wide range of plant-based foods every day gives you access to more of the many different types of polyphenols. This seems to be superior to focusing on consuming one specific type of polyphenol when it comes to reducing chronic inflammation.\\n4. The class of polyphenols called retinoids produces a green or yellow color in fruits and veggies. So, once again, you can eat by color and know you are getting anti-inflammatory benefits. Look for dark, leafy greens, squashes, and other green and yellow plant-based foods. Remember to pick from a range of colors to get a wider array of polyphenols. You could make a salad with spinach, sliced tomatoes, and chopped yellow bell peppers, for instance—and add a walnut-oil based dressing!\\n5. v4-460px-Reduce-Cytokines-Step-8.jpg\\n6. Green tea contains the category of polyphenols known as flavonoids, which makes it a great hot beverage choice. Red wine contains the polyphenol resveratrol, so having a glass per day may offer anti-inflammatory benefits. Drinking more than 1 or possibly 2 glasses of red wine per day is likely to have more negative than positive health effects, however. Moderate consumption of dark chocolate—1 oz (28 g) servings 3-4 times per week—might also provide you with the health benefits of polyphenols.\\n7. v4-460px-Reduce-Cytokines-Step-4.jpg', 'question_id': 10184644, 'answer_choices': [[0, 3, 1, 4, 7, 2, 6, 5], [4, 3, 1, 6, 7, 2, 5, 0], [3, 6, 0, 5, 4, 7, 1, 2], [3, 1, 2, 7, 4, 0, 6, 5]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1018469.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

Children between the ages of 8 and 18 spend an average of 7.5 hours a day using electronics and media such as TV, cell phones, computers, and video games. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that kids and teens should use media such as this for \"no more than one or two hours per day.\" You can limit tech consumption by establishing a \"curfew\" for media devices, such as requiring them to be shut off before bedtime. Setting up scheduled times when your children are allowed to use media and technology, such as a \"video game hour,\" will help establish boundaries for proper use.

If you have allergies or asthma, open a window or turn on an air purifier while burning it.\\n3. When burned for more than 20-30 minutes, the scent of palo santo can become strong or even overwhelming. To prevent this, choose a room with strong air ventilation and open doors or windows to burn your palo santo in.

You typically can be compensated for the work that you perform as the executor. Compensation levels depend by state. States often peg the amount of compensation to the size of the estate. For example, executors in Oregon are entitled to compensation according to the following formula:\\n7% of the first $1,000 of the estate\\nan additional 4% of any amount over $1,000 but less than $10,000\\nan additional 3% of any amount above $10,000 up to $50,000\\nan additional 2% of any amount over $50,000. As executor in Oregon, you would also be entitled to 1% of non-probate property, e.g., life insurance proceeds.\\n1. Generally, an executor (or “administrator” or “personal representative”) preserves the deceased’s estate in order to pay off debts and taxes before distributing the remainder to the people entitled to it. The full set of duties is extensive. A partial listing includes:\\nFiling the will in the probate court. You must file the will in the appropriate local court even if the will does not state that you must do this. Determining whether the will needs to be probated. Not every will needs to go through probate. Depending on your state, you may be able to avoid probate altogether by using a “summary administration” procedure or by using informal administration. You will need to consult your state law to determine what non-probate options are available. Finding the deceased person’s assets and keeping them safe. You will need to collect estate property held in the hands of other people. You must also protect them. This may require that you rent storage facilities. Contacting agencies and businesses. You will need to close various accounts that the deceased had, such as bank accounts, credit card accounts, and various insurance policies. You will also need to contact pension plans, the Social Security Administration, and any other governmental or private organization that paid the deceased benefits. Finding creditors the deceased owed money to and paying off legitimate claims. If you know the creditors by name, then you will contact them directly. You will probably also have to advertise in a newspaper where the decedent lived. After you receive claims on the estate, you will have to decide which are legitimate and pay them. Contacting anyone in debt to the deceased and collecting on the debts. As the executor, you will need to make sure that you collect on debts owed to the deceased so that this money can be added to the estate and then distributed to beneficiaries. Paying taxes. If the estate owes taxes, then the executor is responsible for making sure that they are paid accurately and on time. Distributing property specifically given to beneficiaries or heirs. The will likely designates specific pieces of property to individual beneficiaries. You will be responsible for coordinating with the beneficiary for delivery or pick-up. Liquidating the remainder of the estate. Some estate property will not be distributed by the will; also, no family members may want them. If this is the case, you need to sell this property and then distribute the proceeds to beneficiaries. Closing the estate. As the executor, you will be responsible for informing the court that all assets have been distributed and you must petition to close the estate.\\n2. If you have questions about being an executor, including the extent of fiduciary duties, then you should contact an experienced attorney. A probate attorney can also help you consider whether or not you want to be the executor in the first place. Should you become the executor, some states will require that you hire an attorney. Florida, for example, requires that the estate be represented by an attorney. You can find an experience probate attorney by contacting your state’s bar association, which should run a referral service.\\n3. v4-460px-Become-the-Executor-of-an-Estate-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Become-the-Executor-of-an-Estate-Step-4-Version-2.jpg', 'question_id': 101882, 'answer_choices': [[1, 4, 2, 0, 3], [2, 0, 3, 4, 1], [1, 3, 0, 4, 2], [2, 3, 1, 4, 0]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10188.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-10188-2-1.jpg\\n1. It\\'s important to know what kind of speech you\\'re giving and why your audience is gathering to hear it in order to get started on the right foot. Understand if your speech is meant to be a personal narrative, informative, persuasive or ceremonial. Personal narrative. A narrative is just another word for story. If you\\'re asked to tell a story about yourself, find out if the intention is to use something that\\'s happened to you in order to teach a lesson, convey a moral, offer inspiration or simply to entertain. Informative speech. There are two kinds of informative speeches:  process and expository. If you\\'re charged with doing a process speech, the idea is for you to explain how something is done, how something is made or how something works. You take your audience step-by-step through the process. If your speech is  meant to be expository, your job is to take what might be a complex subject and break it down into sections as a way of educating your audience about the topic. Persuasive speech. If you\\'re meant to persuade, then your job is to convince your audience to adopt a particular way of thinking, a belief or a behavior that you advocate for. Ceremonial speech. Ceremonial speeches run the gamut from wedding toasts to eulogies, from graduation speeches to farewell addresses. Many of these speeches are intended to be short and the focus is often on entertaining, inspiring or increasing the audience\\'s appreciation for someone or something.\\n2. v4-460px-10188-4-1.jpg\\n3.

Pumpkins are an integral part of fall decor, and you can usually find them at grocery stores for relatively cheap! There are several ways you can creatively incorporate pumpkins into your fall decor. Remove the insides of the pumpkin and fill them with your favorite seasonal flower. Taller pumpkins work best for this, but the shorter ones can work too if you cut the flower stems short. Carve or paint them to make them one-of-a-kind. You can add your own designs to the pumpkins, or simply change their colors.

Victoria is one of the best states for finding koalas in the wild. Due to its wet and temperate climate, the koala population in this region has grown consistently over the last few years, in contrast to other states in Australia. Koalas are most likely to be found in Gippsland and on the Great Ocean Road in Victoria. Raymond Island and the You Yangs are also popular destinations.\\n1. v4-460px-Spot-Koalas-Step-4.jpg\\n2. You can see koalas in captivity anywhere in Australia and your sighting will be virtually guaranteed. You may even have the chance to cuddle a koala and take close-up photos. You can cuddle a koala in Queensland, South Australia or Western Australia. Zoos, sanctuaries and parks often act as centres of education and research for the protection of koalas. Viewing koalas in captivity can therefore act as a means of supporting their survival. Recommended venues for seeing koalas in captivity include Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary in Brisbane; Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve in Canberra; Healesville Sanctuary in Melbourne and WILD LIFE on Hamilton Island.\\n3. It’s relatively difficult to see koalas in the wild in New South Wales, as they are somewhat endangered there.

With an unloaded shotgun, ensure that the safety is on and practice bringing the gun into the firing position quickly. Push the gun straight out from your body, then tuck the butt of the shotgun firmly into your shoulder, keeping it tight against the pocket your shoulder created with your body.

The amount of time that it takes for the glass to melt depends on the size of the microwave kiln, the composition of the glass, and the wattage of the microwave. Generally the lower the wattage of the microwave, the longer the firing time will be. Refer to the instruction manual of your microwave kiln to determine the exact firing time that will be needed the melt the glass. For simply melting the glass, 3 to 4 minutes usually does the trick. However if you are fusing glass pieces together, it could take up to 12 minutes.\\n1. v4-460px-Melt-Glass-Step-8.jpg\\n2. Make sure that there is at least at least a 6 in (15 cm) space allowance around the kiln as you open it, as it will remain very hot for a long time. When opening, place the kiln lid upside down to prevent heat building up beneath it. Removing the lid too soon can result in thermal shock, which may cause the glass to break.\\n3. v4-460px-Melt-Glass-Step-4.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Melt-Glass-Step-6.jpg\\n5. Center the kiln base on the rotator tray. Check that the fiber paper and glass is still in the right place. In some microwave models, the rotator tray can vibrate or shift slightly while it's running. This will cause the glass to move and may disrupt the firing process. If this is the case, remove the rotator tray from the microwave and place the kiln in the centre of the microwave. A rotator tray is more effective however, as this will help to distribute the heat and to melt the glass evenly.\\n6. The fibre paper sits on the kiln shelf and is what the glass rests on to melt. A square which is large enough to cover the kiln base from the glass, but small enough to not touch the sides is ideal. The kiln fiber paper prevents the melting glass from sticking to the insulating base of the kiln. Test the fiber paper for size by placing it on the kiln base and putting the cover on.

When life is a challenge, it can seem as though nothing is going right. Overgeneralizing is something people do often because they look at the world through negative lenses. The truth is that there are still a lot of great things about your life. If you have a roof over your head and food to eat today, you are doing much better than many people in the world.

After you allow yourself to be comforted by something that is warm and yummy, you may feel just a bit better about your situation. Cuddle with a pet. Take time to love your pet for a few minutes. Research shows that petting an animal has amazing health benefits. It reduces stress, which lowers your blood pressure. Engage in a hobby you enjoy. You may not feel like it because you are feeling low, but if you force yourself to get started, you may just end up seeing your mood change. It is your hobby for a reason. You enjoy it. Use it to help you during difficult times. Find a new hobby. If you're just not interested in doing any of the hobbies you have enjoyed in the past, it might be time to find a new one. Listen to music. People who are sad tend to listen to depressing music. Avoid the urge to do that because it will only make you feel worse. Research has found that listening to upbeat music can improve your mood.\\n4. Journaling has a positive effect on your physical and mental well-being.When you journal about all of the great things in your life, you will start to remember many more of them. As you start to gather all of the positives in your life, you may just start to feel better about things because you will remember your life is not so bad. It's best to journal a little each day. That way you can go back and look at all of the great things that have happened in your life. Reserve one journal for what you're proud of, so you can read it when you're feeling down. If you like to write about the bad times too, have another journal for that.

Part A of the exam will ask you to determine if two addresses are identical at a very fast speed. Spend some time quickly comparing similar addresses to determine whether they have any discrepancies between them. For instance, you might be asked to determine whether “123 Kalimazoo Road, Myrtle Beach, SC, 29577” and “123 Kalamazoo Road, Myrtle Beach, SC, 29577” are different. The questions in Part A will ask you whether the two addresses have different street addresses, different zip codes, different street addresses AND zip codes, or no differences. You will only have roughly 10 seconds to answer each question in Part A, so train yourself to spot all the differences between addresses in about this much time.\\n3. By far the hardest portion of the exam for most people is Part C, where you're asked to memorize the address range for various delivery routes and then sort addresses into their proper routes. To best this section, strengthen your memorization and recall skills. Since mail routes are combinations of numbers and letters, a technique you might try would be visualization. For example, if the 400 block of Jackson Boulevard was marked as Route A, you might visualize 400 Andrew Jacksons and say “400 Jacksons is A lot of people.”\\nFocus specifically on being able to memorize particular numbers and street names together. For instance, a route may include 100-399 Johnson Ave, while 400-699 Johnson Ave may fall under a separate delivery route. Be sure you practice recalling names and numbers correctly. Any address that includes a misspelled street name needs to be marked as undeliverable rather than be categorized in the route it seems to belong to.\\n4. v4-460px-Pass-a-Private-School-Entrance-Exam-Step-3-Version-3.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Study-Math-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\", 'question_id': 10193270, 'answer_choices': [[1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 0], [3, 0, 5, 4, 1, 2], [4, 2, 0, 5, 3, 1], [3, 4, 1, 2, 0, 5]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10193842.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Learn-Bengali-Step-4.jpg\\n1.

For refreshments, go with light French wines Pinot Noir or Pinot Grigio, or serve chilled champagne. As a non-alcoholic option, offer citron pressé, or make-your-own lemonade: lay out lemon juice, water, sugar, and ice to let each guest make their drink as tart or sweet as they desire. Citron pressé is traditionally served in French cafes, where waiters will squeeze a lemon into the glass and let the customer mix in water and sugar cubes to their preferences.\\n4. v4-460px-Celebrate-Bastille-Day-Step-8.jpg\\n5. Finish off your relaxed Bastille Day celebrations by putting on a classic French film or two.

Many French people opt for low-key Bastille Day celebrations, spending their day off enjoying the warm weather with friends and family. For a relaxed celebration at your own home, invite friends and family over after work and host a backyard picnic or barbeque with French foods and decorations. You can set out tables to eat on or lay blankets on the ground for a more traditional picnic. To put a costume-party spin on this tradition, invite guests to show up in their best “French” attire, whether that's a beret and striped shirt or old-fashioned suits and Marie Antoinette-inspired dresses.\\n8. The most important aspect of any Bastille Day celebration is the food. Prepare simple, satisfying sandwiches with fresh French bread, ham, creamy butter, and seasonal veggies, and serve it with a side of cole ratatouille, or vegetable stew. Top off your guests' plates with savory crepes. You can make ratatouille with vegetables like eggplant, tomatoes, zucchini, and red pepper. Go online or check out a French cookbook for a simple recipe. To make your own crepes, mix batter from an egg, milk, butter, flour, and parsley and cook it in a flat, thin crepe pan.

Popular choices are \"cage\" or \"kennel\" or \"kennel up.\" Get your dog\\'s attention, then use the command word. They won\\'t have a clue what you\\'re talking about at first, so gently lead them to the cage. Repeat your command word a few times while you do this.\\n2. Once you have the correct equipment, you can start introducing your dog to the crate. You need to help the dog understand that the kennel is a safe place and not a punishment before you require the dog to stay in the kennel for a long period of time. Begin by putting the kennel in the dog\\'s space with the door left open all the time. When you first bring the crate home, don\\'t put it together with the dog close by. A crate can seem very strange to a dog and can be intimidating. Instead, take the dog out of the area, assemble the crate, put it in a corner, and let the dog come check it out on his own terms.\\n3. v4-460px-Kennel-Train-an-Older-Dog-That-Barks-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Kennel-Train-an-Older-Dog-That-Barks-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n5.

Make sure the crate is large enough for the dog to turn around easily.

If you are shy about talking during the week at school in class or to your peers in the hallways, you should get into the habit of talking with your retainer in your mouth on weekends. On the weekends, you may walk around the house and talk to yourself or talk to your parents. It can be less intimidating to talk to an empty room or to sympathetic parents.\\n3. To get more comfortable with talking while wearing your retainer, you should start by speaking slowly to those closest to you on a daily basis. The more you practice speaking, the more comfortable you will become with talking with a retainer. You should be able to talk with relative ease within one month to two months of getting your retainer. Your tongue will eventually adapt to the retainer. If you practice a lot, using all types of words, you will eventually be able to speak normally. As you start practicing saying words while wearing your retainer, you may notice that you spit or drool when you speak. This is normal, as your mouth will be more full of saliva than normal due to the retainer. You can use a cloth to catch any saliva around your mouth or chin when you are first getting used to wearing and talking with your retainer. The reason you may produce more spit with a retainer is because your mouth perceives it as a foreign object. Your mouth reacts to this foreign object the same way it reacts to a piece of food in your mouth — it increases the flow of saliva.\\n4. Singing is another good way to help your mouth adapt to the retainer. You can sing the chorus of your favorite song to yourself in the shower or to an audience of family and friends. Maybe you choose a simple nursery rhyme or familiar tune that contains simple words. You can then practice singing this out loud once a day until you can sing the song clearly and without any issues.', 'question_id': 1019476, 'answer_choices': [[2, 4, 0, 3, 1], [1, 4, 0, 2, 3], [2, 4, 3, 0, 1], [3, 0, 4, 1, 2]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10194888.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Become-a-Software-Engineer-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\\n1. Global sites like Monster, LinkedIn Jobs, and Glassdoor are used widely in Singapore. You can find a large variety of work listed on sites like these. Online job boards offer a lot of conveniences, but they make it harder to stand out. If you find a job you like in the job board, go to that company’s site and see if you can apply directly through them.

If you don't already have a business in mind, brainstorm some ideas. Make a list of the things you're really interested in. These don't need to be businesses, but just things you really enjoy. For example, you might enjoy music, building, athletics, or games. If you happen to think of business ideas too, that's great! For example, you might already know that you want to make bracelets and sell them at a neighborhood market. Or you may just write down that you enjoy dogs, playing the piano, or drawing.\\n3. While it's a good idea to have a few financial goals, such as making money after a month or two, keep in mind that there are other ways to succeed in business. Give yourself manageable goals such as:\\nBuilding a customer base\\nSelling your product or service in a new venue or area\\nGetting new investors\\nGetting good reviews from customers\\n4. Even if you're selling a service, it's a good idea to have a website so people can contact you, read reviews, and see what services you offer. Set up other social media accounts so you can show pictures of your work. Depending on how old you are, you might need your parents’ help to set up and run your online accounts. For example, if you baked a cake for someone's birthday party, ask the customer if you can share a photo of the cake at the party. Think about incentives you can offer customers. For example, offer a slight discount if they sign up for a regular service instead of a one-time service. You can also reach customers all over the world by running at least part of your business online!\\n5. Make a list of all the equipment you'll need and ask an adult to help you get them. It's also important to get training that's necessary for the job you want to do. For example, if you want to start a babysitting business, you should probably take first aid and childcare classes. You may be able to buy some simpler materials on your own if you have a little money to work with. For example, if you want to make bracelets, you can start by buying some beads and jewelry wire at a craft store. If you need larger equipment, such as a lawn mower, talk with an adult about borrowing or renting the machine.\\n6. v4-460px-Start-a-Business-%28for-Kids%29-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\", 'question_id': 1019565, 'answer_choices': [[6, 0, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3], [4, 0, 6, 1, 2, 5, 3], [3, 5, 0, 4, 2, 1, 6], [2, 1, 5, 6, 4, 0, 3]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10195885.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. If you don't have the time to wash your car every week you can go to a car wash. This is far from ideal, but if you are going to do it, make sure the brushes never touch the car in the process.

This could be just a quarter of your batch, half of it, or even all of it. It would be a good idea to siphon off more than you think you need. You may lose 4 to 6 ounces (120 to 180 mL) of beer for every 1 gallon (3.8 L) due to the heating process. Consider adding about 4 to 6 ounces (120 to 180 mL) of water to the beer after you siphon it out. This will make up for any liquid that's lost without sacrificing flavor and body. Pour the beer that you want to remove the alcohol from into a sterilized pot. Leave the rest of the beer in the fermenter.\\n1. v4-460px-Make-Nonalcoholic-Beer-Step-4.jpg\\n2. Hops are part of what make beer taste bitter. When you heat beer to make it non-alcoholic, you’ll make it taste more bitter. Using fewer hops is one way to cut down on this bitterness. For example, if the recipe calls for 2 ounces (48 g) of hops, use 1 ounce (24 g) instead. If you want to increase the hoppy flavor without overpowering the beer, use hops that have low alpha acids.\\n3. v4-460px-Make-Nonalcoholic-Beer-Step-6.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Make-Nonalcoholic-Beer-Step-2.jpg\\n5. How you do this depends on what kind of beer you're brewing and what kind of equipment you're using. Each recipe and brewing kit will be a little different, so be sure to read the everything carefully. Non-alcoholic beer starts out as regular beer, so just follow the recipe. The only changes you should make to the process are changes you made earlier to the recipe, such as the amount and type of hops.\\n6. When you make non-alcoholic beer, you have to heat it to burn off the alcohol. This will make the beer taste very bitter, and not in a good way. You can reduce the bitterness by choosing a recipe that doesn't taste very bitter to begin with, such as a wheat-based recipe or a red ale recipe. Don't use a recipe for pale ale, which is very bitter to begin with. Non-alcoholic pale ale will end up tasting even more bitter by the end.\", 'question_id': 10196959, 'answer_choices': [[1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4, 0], [3, 0, 4, 1, 6, 2, 5], [6, 4, 2, 1, 5, 3, 0], [5, 2, 4, 3, 0, 6, 1]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1019715.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Improve-Composition-in-Your-Photographs-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n1. If you can, try to compose your photo so you’re showcasing an odd number of elements. For some reason, the human eye tends to see groups of odd-numbered objects or people as more visually interesting than even-numbered groups. For instance, you might photograph a group of 5 ducks walking down the sidewalk or 3 friends walking together in the snow. These elements don’t always have to be the same thing. You could photograph a dog and a cat sitting next to each other while looking up at a bird, for instance, or you might shoot an interior setting featuring a couch, a lamp, and a large painting.\\n2. v4-460px-Improve-Composition-in-Your-Photographs-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n3. When you’re choosing what to photograph, look for an interesting detail or object to be the main point of interest in your picture. This can help keep your picture from being too cluttered, which can leave the viewer unsure of where to look. For instance, you might choose to photograph one person rather than a whole group, or you might feature one interesting stone on the bank of a river, instead of trying to focus on the entire scene. This doesn’t mean that you only have to photograph one object. For instance, the contrast of a flock of dark birds silhouetted against a hazy sky can make a very interesting picture. Similarly,  if you’re looking at a row of cars, you might frame the shot so one car is the focus, with the rest of the cars extending into the background.\\n4. Contrast creates tension, which will make any picture more interesting. You can feature visual contrast, such as differences in size, shape, or color, as well as more subtle contrast like light and shadow or sharpness and softness. However, you can also choose a more thematic contrast, like taking a picture of something new next to something very old, something clean against something dirty, or a very ordered sequence near something chaotic. A person with half their face covered by a shadow can create a dramatic effect, for instance. Another way to create contrast is to include various textures, like paving stones nestled in the grass or a gravelly beach against smooth water.', 'question_id': 1019715, 'answer_choices': [[3, 2, 1, 0, 4], [4, 1, 0, 2, 3], [4, 0, 1, 3, 2], [2, 3, 1, 0, 4]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1019718.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Tell-Your-Partner-You-Have-Herpes-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n1. While genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease, sleeping with someone who has herpes does not mean you will are going to automatically get herpes. Most people who have herpes are shedding the disease only a small percent of the time. In fact there are many sexually active couples where one partner has herpes and one partner does not have the disease. Being aware of having the virus and letting any sexual partners know about your diagnosis is a big step to preventing the spread of virus to others.\\n2. It’s important to get educated, if you aren’t already, about the facts of genital herpes. This will help you prepare to answer any questions your partner may have about herpes as well as any questions you may have about the virus. Genital herpes is a common infection that is usually transmitted through sexual contact, or direct contact with an infected blister or sore. It can also be caused by HSV-1, the virus that causes cold sores on your lips and face, through oral or genital contact. The virus can be transmitted when no symptoms are present on the person you had sexual contact with, and often goes undetected and undiagnosed. In fact, about 80% of the US population already has HSV-1 and got it sometime during their childhood from being kissed by a parent, friend, or relative. Genital herpes is very treatable, and is not life-threatening. Anyone who is sexually active is at risk of catching genital herpes, regardless of their gender, race, or social class. HSV-2 infection is usually passed on during vaginal or anal sex. HSV-1 is usually transmitted by oral sex (mouth to genital contact).', 'question_id': 1019718, 'answer_choices': [[2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 2], [2, 1, 0], [2, 0, 1]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1019782.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

Don't expect to immediately take amazing photographs. Your cat will probably be curious for a few minutes.\\n2. Some cats will enjoy being photographed longer than others will. Pay attention to signs that your cat no longer wants to be the subject of your attention. If your cat seems distracted, gets angry (hisses, scratches), or tries to walk away, end the photo shoot.

Do this to achieve a longer drive. A common failure amongst golfers is bringing the driver too far back during the backswing. This causes a loss in control of the club. A powerful, more controlled swing can achieved by controlling your wrists and rotating your body into the shot, thus resulting in a more distance. Your hands should be level with your shoulders when you bring the club back.\\n1. One of the most basic tips to get greater distance is to anchor (firmly press into the ground) your foot and your body behind the ball. The foot you must anchor is the foot that is behind the ball. For right handed players it will be the right foot, and the left foot for left handed players. If you lift your foot too soon when swinging the club you will lose power and distance in the shot.\\n2. v4-460px-Improve-Your-Golf-Game-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Improve-Your-Golf-Game-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\\n4.

One of the most secure ways to hang your moving blanket directly onto the wall is to nail it into place. Use a hammer to drive a nail into each of the 4 corners of the blanket. To ensure the blanket hangs straight, it’s best to nail the top 2 corners into place first, then the bottom corners. You can use almost any nail, as long as it’s strong enough to hold the weight of the blanket. A good option is to use 10-penny nails, which are usually about 3 in (7.6 cm) long. Heavy-duty staples can be used in place of nails. Lay the blanket against the wall and press your stapler against the blanket, then pull the trigger. Since using nails or staples will leave holes in the walls, this may not be a good option for soundproofing an apartment, rental house, or dorm room.\\n1. Mounting putty is a removable adhesive that you can use to hang things on the wall without creating any holes. Just roll a small amount between your fingers until it becomes soft, then press it to the wall. Once it sticks, press a corner of the blanket into the putty.

Check the care tag to see if the blanket is made from a fabric which permits air flow, like cotton, linen, rayon, or hemp. Breathable fabrics will absorb sound waves, helping to dampen the noise. A blanket with a dense weave will help the sound waves to continue bouncing around the room, which will amplify the noise. If you’re not sure whether a blanket is made from a breathable fabric, hold it up to your mouth and place one hand on the opposite side of the blanket, then try to blow through the material. If you can feel the air coming through, then the material is breathable and sound waves will be able to penetrate and be absorbed by the blanket.

When you’ve hit a day that makes it hard to feel awesome, sit back and think about how awesome life is. If it’s hard to come up with something, start with your eyes, your arms, and your legs. You sure would miss those if they were gone! Think about your friends, family, and your abilities and accomplishments. Heck, think about the fact that you have the Internet! Life is pretty good. Think about the world, too. How awesome is what\\'s in front of you? Humans, animals, trees, water, the sun - this little blue planet is quite incredible, and you\\'re a part of it!\\n2. How many times did you fudge the truth today? Maybe it wasn’t a full-fledged lie, but you didn’t own up to how you actually felt. You know how it would feel if you did? Awesome, that’s how. Instead of, “yeah, I’d love to go out with you tonight”, or “sure, pizza sounds good”, say, “nah, I’d rather just stay in tonight”, and order yourself Chinese food. In other words, stick to your guns and what you actually think. It’ll be incredibly freeing. It\\'s important to balance between telling the truth and not hurting someone\\'s feelings. Do tell the truth, but phrase it delicately and diplomatically. If you\\'re mad at a friend, and they ask what\\'s up, tell them. Say something like, \"the conversation we had the other day really upset me. I need sometime to myself right now\". That\\'s all it takes, and it\\'ll be hard to argue with. Lying will make you feel guilty and it may hurt your friend\\'s feelings to learn the truth.\\n3. v4-460px-Feel-Awesome-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n4. It’s true: you can’t really feel good without feeling bad. It’s also a little unrealistic to expect anything otherwise: no one feels awesome 100% of the time. So when you want to feel bad, just feel it. When you start feeling good again (and you will), it’ll feel that much better. Crying is proven to make you happier. [1]\\n\\nImagine this. Your entire life you\\'ve eaten pizza, and then one day you have a different pizza and you realize you\\'ve never really, truly experienced a good pizza before this day. It\\'s like that.

Buddha is not a creator god, though some practices do see him as divine. That said, prayer is not meant as an offering to Buddha. Rather, it is a way to deepen your own spirituality.

Speech and language disorders are very common among CP patients. The person should undergo speech therapy to improve literacy, pronunciation and socialization skills, and to better support learning and education in children. Speech therapy can also help to improve the person’s ability to eat and chew. Children with CP may be particularly self-conscious about their speech. Therapy can help eliminate that self-consciousness, make it easier for children to socialize, and help increase their overall confidence and independence. Common exercises that are used in speech therapy include using language cards and mirrors to help children improve pronunciation; jaw, lip, and tongue exercises to strengthen these muscles; and breathing and blowing exercises to strengthen abdominal muscles.\\n1. v4-460px-Manage-Cerebral-Palsy-Step-6.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Manage-Cerebral-Palsy-Step-2.jpg\\n3.

Unfortunately, some agencies are less honest about this than others and advertise that their employees meet these requirements when they don’t. Any agency that you’re interviewing with should be able to provide information about these guidelines and how they meet them.\\n4. v4-460px-Work-with-a-Home-Care-Nursing-Agency-Step-2-Version-2.jpg', 'question_id': 102060, 'answer_choices': [[0, 1, 2, 4, 3], [3, 4, 1, 2, 0], [1, 4, 3, 0, 2], [3, 2, 0, 1, 4]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1020624.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Writing down a summary will help you to form the game’s main purpose. Detail the main action of the game. For example, if it involves some people hiding and some people looking, explain how many people are hiding. Where people are allowed to hide. Who is looking? What happens when the looker finds someone who is hiding? You want to come up with a central aspect to your game. Does it revolve around you and your friends running around the neighborhood? Can you play it inside? Do you need any equipment? These are questions you should answer when writing down a summary to better establish your game.\\n1. Play a quick test round to see how well the game works and if everyone has an easy time understanding it. You want your game to be fun. But you also want it to be easy to play. If you’re playing some sort of flashlight tag, hide and seek hybrid game, this test round will give you a good idea of how well people understand the rules. You'll learn how easy or hard it is to play the game in your area. Then you can adjust. Perhaps you find that with the number of people it’s too hard to find a hiding spot or people aren’t stopping when tagged by the flashlight. After your test round, make the necessary adjustments. Maybe you decide that the flashlight is only used to help the seeker find other players. But the seeker still has to physically tag a player to get that player out. Talk with your friends and find out what everyone liked and didn’t like about the test round. Then make adjustments.\\n2. v4-460px-Make-Your-Own-Game-Step-2-Version-4.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Make-Your-Own-Game-Step-6-Version-4.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Make-Your-Own-Game-Step-4-Version-4.jpg\\n5.

Feedback from your friends will help you to get some good ideas to add to your game. It will also help you get other people to play with you. Your friends are more likely to play your game if you let your friends add rules and ideas.

If the child is unresponsive, the first thing to do is check her pulse. If the child does not respond, you need to begin CPR immediately. Do not check the pulse for more than 10 seconds. If the victim does not have a pulse, her heart is not beating and you will be required to perform chest compressions. To check the neck (carotid) pulse, feel for a pulse on the side of the victim's neck closest to you by placing the tips of your first two fingers beside the Adam's apple. (Be aware that the Adam's apple is usually not visible on a female, and may not even be very visible on a boy who has not yet gone through puberty.) To check the wrist (radial) pulse, place your first two fingers on the thumb side of the victim's wrist. Other pulse locations are the groin and ankle. To check the groin (femoral) pulse, press the tips of two fingers into the middle of the groin. To check the ankle (posterior tibial) pulse, place your first two fingers on the inside of the ankle.\\n1. v4-460px-Tell-Your-Wife-You-Don%27t-Want-Any-More-Children-Step-2.jpg\\n2. If you come across someone who is unconscious, you need to quickly make sure there are no dangers to yourself if you choose to help them. Is there a car exhaust running? A gas stove? Is there a fire? Are electrical lines down? If there is anything that could endanger you or the victim, see if there is something you can do to counteract it. Open a window, turn off the stove, or put out the fire if  possible. However, if there is nothing you can do to counteract the danger, move the victim. The best way to move the victim is by placing a blanket or a coat underneath her back and pulling on the coat or blanket. If there is a chance the person has suffered a spinal injury two people should move her to prevent any twisting of the head and neck.\\n3. v4-460px-Do-CPR-on-a-Child-Step-2.jpg\", 'question_id': 1020633, 'answer_choices': [[2, 3, 0, 1], [2, 1, 3, 0], [3, 0, 2, 1], [3, 0, 2, 1]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10206412.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Be-Independent-in-a-Relationship-Step-2.jpg\\n1. Taking time away from your partner to maintain your independence does not mean seeing other people. Maintain your commitment to your relationship by not betraying your partner’s trust when taking time off. If you’re taking time away because you feel overwhelmed and want to reassert your independence, having an affair might seem like a tempting way of accomplishing this goal. However, affairs can be devastating when discovered by monogamous partners and your relationship may not recover if you betray your partner’s trust this way. Reassuring your partner of your fidelity is also a key aspect of taking time away from the relationship. Remember, open communication is very important.\\n2. v4-460px-Be-Independent-in-a-Relationship-Step-6.jpg\\n3. Don’t let being in a relationship keep you from doing the things you want to do. Have hobbies and interests you don’t share with your partner to help nurture your independence and maintain your sense of self. Take this opportunity to find something you like doing that your partner doesn’t necessarily enjoy. This way, you can affirm your independence and pursue a hobby that won’t ask any sacrifice of your partner. Beyond being a source of independence, hobbies can also have a huge impact on your well-being. Studies show that hobbies like painting, writing, and hiking can lower blood pressure, promote creative thinking, and foster a sense of satisfaction. Remember this when you tell your partner why independent hobbies are a good thing!\\n4. v4-460px-Be-Independent-in-a-Relationship-Step-4.jpg\\n5. It’s easy to stop seeing your other friends when you’re in a relationship and become dependent on your partner for social interaction. Make time to see friends and family on a regular basis to help maintain your independence. How often to see friends and family ultimately depends on your own social needs. As often as once a week or as seldom as once a month might be all you need to maintain a healthy social life outside your relationship. Your friends and family will also serve as a support group when your relationship goes through hard times and will help to keep you grounded. Remember, they love you for you.

You have brief thoughts throughout the day that are triggered by a situation. You may not notice or pay attention to these thoughts, but with CBT it is important to have awareness of these quick thoughts. Pay specific attention to negative (or maladaptive) thoughts that you have when reflecting on a situation. Maladaptive automatic thoughts are distorted reflections on an event, but you may accept them as true. These maladaptive thoughts may then trigger feelings of sadness, anxiety, frustration, or hopelessness. Maladaptive: \"I can\\'t believe I got such a bad grade on this exam! I\\'m a failure, and I\\'ll never amount to anything.\" This thought can lead to a spiral of negativity and hopelessness. Positive: \"This is just one exam. Everyone does badly on an exam sometimes.

If your core beliefs are founded on a falsehood, then those beliefs themselves might not be true. Even if they are true, pondering where your fundamental beliefs come from can give you a stronger understanding of yourself. For example, many people get their core beliefs from the people they’re raised by. If your parents mistreated you, you might have a core belief that you’re not worthy of love. Separating your parents’ behavior towards you from your actual worth will show you that your core belief—that you’re unworthy of love—isn’t true at all.\\n5. Set aside 10 minutes every day to sit and observe this present moment. Note the thoughts and judgments that arise and let them pass on by.

You don't need much of the resin to create a lot of smoke and scent. A tiny piece of resin, not much bigger than a grain of rice, will do to begin with. You can always burn more when it stops smoking. Some people like to pour salt in the center of the disc, which helps the resin burn slower. If the coal is still hot after the frankincense burns up, you can add another piece to it. If you get too much smoke, you can take the resin off the charcoal and set it aside for a moment.

Rhyming books are a great way to teach kids about words that sound the same. That helps the child recognize patterns in language, increasing their reading skills. Try reading aloud to the child, and then have them say it back to you. You can also say nursery rhymes with the child.\\n1. Learning rhyming words helps the child identify what words sound alike, even when they're spelled differently. Making it into a little game helps take the pressure off the child. For example, you could give the child 3 words, and ask if they rhyme or not: Do ball, call, and stall rhyme? Do chat, fate, and peep rhyme? Do cast, man, and people rhyme? You can also ask the child to come up with a rhyme: What do you think rhymes with cat? Can you come up with 2 words that rhyme with feat?\\n2. One reading difficulty is not being able to distinguish sounds properly, making it more difficult to pronounce and spell words. Kids with dyslexia often struggle with this issue, and working on basic listening skills can help the child develop a better awareness of how sounds affect words. This process helps kids sound out and recognize words they've heard before when they see them for the first time in writing. For instance, try putting items, such as coins, sand, leaves, and buttons, in boxes, and then asking the child to identify what's in them. Help them by asking leading questions: Does it sound soft or hard? Do you think it's metal or plastic? How many buttons do you think are inside? You can also have them close their eyes and identify everyday sounds. You can simply wait for sounds to happen or record them and play them for the child.\\n3. v4-460px-Help-a-Child-with-Reading-Difficulties-Step-6.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Help-a-Child-with-Reading-Difficulties-Step-2.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Help-a-Child-with-Reading-Difficulties-Step-4.jpg\", 'question_id': 10207657, 'answer_choices': [[1, 5, 3, 4, 2, 0], [3, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5], [2, 4, 1, 5, 0, 3], [2, 1, 3, 4, 0, 5]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1020818.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Care-for-a-Rottweiler-Puppy-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Care-for-a-Rottweiler-Puppy-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\\n2. Give yourself plenty of time to make a decision about which puppy to take home. You should immediately make sure the puppies and mother are healthy. Then, spend time watching for individual personalities. You won't want to choose a Rottweiler that's timid (since he could become a fearful biter) nor overly aggressive. Look for a puppy that is friendly, approachable, and plays well with his litter mates.\\n3. Since there are many differences between dog breeds, it's important to determine if a Rottweiler is right for you. As with any breed, Rottweilers have their own distinct personality traits and breed-specific characteristics. The better you understand Rottweilers, the more aware you will be about the potential challenges related to raising a Rottweiler and how to react appropriately. These puppies become large dogs (around 110 pounds as adults) that are fiercely loyal to their owners and initially wary of strangers. Rottweilers need firm guidance from someone who understand dog psychology and behavior, so it helps to be an experienced dog owner with a history of raising good-natured dogs. The potential owner needs to be honest about whether she possesses these skills. Because of a Rottweiler's physical size, a cross Rottweiler who won't get off the sofa when you ask, is a dangerous Rottweiler. To learn more about Rottweilers, go to local dog shows and talk to breeders and other Rottweiler owners. Don't forget to check your homeowner's insurance policy. Some insurance policies are void if you get a Rottweiler or any other breed they have labeled as potentially dangerous, even if this labelling is erroneous. If you rent your home, you will need to contact your landlord before adopting a Rottweiler (or any other animal for that manner) to make sure he is welcome.\\n4. Local humane societies or your veterinarian can insert a microchip below your Rottweiler's skin. This can help someone return your puppy to you or an animal shelter if he runs off. You should also put an identifying collar around your puppy's neck. It should include your contact information. Talk with your vet about spaying or neutering your puppy, which will prevent unwanted litters and which can offer health benefits. Spaying female puppies can reduce stress and discomfort usually experienced when she's in heat, eliminate the risk of mammary and uterine cancer, and prevents unwanted litters. Neutering male puppies can reduce the chances of roaming, fighting, and testicular cancer.\", 'question_id': 1020818, 'answer_choices': [[2, 3, 4, 1, 0], [3, 0, 2, 1, 4], [2, 1, 0, 4, 3], [0, 4, 3, 2, 1]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10208770.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Answer-Discussion-Questions-Step-2.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Answer-Discussion-Questions-Step-4.jpg\\n2. There are three types of keywords that can help you to better outline and understand your question—task words, content words, and limiting words. By picking these words out, you can define what the question is asking and how to answer it. Content words are the nouns usually that give you the bulk of what the ideas are about. They will let you know the who, what, when, and where that you need to know about in order to answer. Content words in the example would be “chapters 7 & 8 on emotional intelligence”. Limiting words are often phrases or adjectives that give you hints as to what the question might be looking for specifically. They might seem like filler words, but they are not. Every word in a discussion question is a clue to the answer. Limiting words for the example would be “your own,” which indicates the example should not be one already discussed in the class or text, and “at least three of the… concepts,” which dictates how many concepts you need to apply in the answer.\\n3. Often discussion questions can run long and may actually be multiple questions in one. When answering, you will want to answer all the parts of the question. Look for conjunctions, such as the word “and,” that may be breaking the question into multiple thoughts. It sometimes helps to rewrite the question into its component pieces separately. Then, you can focus on one part at a time. For example: “Using the information from chapters 7 & 8 on emotional intelligence, give your own example that illustrates at least three of the author's main concepts.” Up to the first comma tells you what chapters' information you need to apply to your answer. “[G]ive your own example” lets you know to make up an applicable response that wasn't demonstrated in class already.

To begin dating a building by style, look for unique details such as moldings around doors and windows, columns, and other decorative touches. These can help pinpoint the architectural style of the building. Once you've determined the style, you can usually date the building to at least within a decade when that style was popular where the building is located. Once you have photographs, you can easily compare them to images you see online or in books. For example, you can do an image search with your photographs to find similar images. From there, you might be able to find a building of similar style with a definitive date of construction. In former colonies, architectural styles may have a later period of popularity than in the colonizing country. For example, the Georgian style of architecture was popular in Great Britain in the early 1700s, homes and buildings in this style were popular in the United States through the late 1800s.\\n2. Pattern books with details of architectural styles and plans have been published since the 18th century. Comparing illustrations and images in these books can help you determine when a building was constructed. University libraries and research libraries often have historical pattern books available. If there's a university near you that also has an architectural school, that can be a good place to start.\\n3. v4-460px-Date-Buildings-Step-4.jpg\\n4. Manufacturers of moldings, fittings, and other building details published catalogues that you can use to help you estimate the original date of the building. Any markings on those items are clues to help you locate the original manufacturer. Look for a symbol or brand name. If you see any manufacturer's seals or other markings through visual inspection, take a photo so you can research that marking further. In many cases you have to remove the fixture to properly inspect it and find any markings from the manufacturer. If you don't own the property, make sure you have the owner's permission. There is an online house dating tool available at http://www.bricksandbrass.co.uk/houseage/house_dating_tool.php that can help you date an old house based on the building materials and original fixtures used.

One of the biggest needs your snail will have is adequate food. If your snail doesn't have enough food it will go hungry, but with too much food the water quality will quickly deteriorate. Most snails enjoy having plants in the tank to graze on. They also eat algae, whether it is found naturally on the tank's walls or provided in the form of store-bought algae wafers. Some snails require other food sources, such as fish food or bottom feeder tablets. Depending on the species of snail you choose, you may need to feed it every day or just a couple times each week. Some experts recommend feeding aquatic snails as much food as those snails can consume in under three minutes, twice daily. This will require some trial and error, so make adjustments accordingly. As a general rule, if you provide supplemental food to your snail and it hasn't touched that food in two days, you may be feeding it too much/often. It could also indicate that your snail does not care for that food source, so try different options and gauge your snail's response. Talk to a qualified aquarium expert at your local pet store or at a local college/university to ensure that your snail gets the care it needs.\\n2. v4-460px-1020953-4.jpg\\n3. If you plan on caring for saltwater snails, you will need to prepare a suitable environment for those snails. Preparing saltwater for marine snails is no different than preparing saltwater for a tank of any other marine creatures, such as saltwater fish or corals. The biggest thing you'll need is a special salt mixture, as household salt cannot be added to water to create a marine environment. Test your tap water for nitrates. You can purchase a water testing kit from your local pet store or through an online retailer. Use purified water if your tap water is high in nitrates, as this water may not be safe for aquatic invertebrates. Common methods of purifying tap water are reverse osmosis, deionization, and ion exchange. Purchase an aquarium salt mix from your local pet store or online. Mix approximately 35 grams of salt mix per liter of water to closely replicate natural sea water. Consider purchasing a salinity measurement kit to ensure that your salt to water ratios are stable. Most aquarium owners who measure salinity use either a hydrometer (typically the least expensive option), a refractometer, or an electronic salinity meter.\", 'question_id': 1020953, 'answer_choices': [[3, 2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 3, 0], [1, 0, 3, 2], [2, 3, 0, 1]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1021142.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Play-With-Dogs-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n1.

Toss your shiitake, wood ear, or other traditional Asian mushrooms with rice, meat, vegetables, and a savory sauce for easy one-pan cooking. If you like, you can even drizzle in a little broth to amplify the mushroom flavor. Mushrooms tend to shrink quite a bit under intense heat, so you may need to use more than the amount listed if you want the proportions of your different ingredients to come out just right. Firm, filling mushrooms are substantial enough to serve as an alternative to meat in vegetarian and vegan dishes.\\n2. When preparing dishes with liquid bases, you can either use the mushrooms by themselves or add a splash of the leftover broth to turn the taste factor up a notch. The liquid you soak your dried mushrooms in will be highly concentrated, so be careful not to overdo it.

Once you’ve spaced out where you are going to attach the clips, they are ready to be attached. This process starts with nailing them into the parallel beam.

Income protection insurance is another good consideration alongside your emergency fund. And if you are in a country where health care is expensive and your employer isn't funding health insurance, you'll need this as well.

With fine and oily hair, wash your hair once or twice a week to stop the buildup of excess oils. Rinse your hair without shampoo between washes to remove any dirt or sweat from exercise. No one likes post-workout hair!

It can be hard to feel accomplished if you spent the entire day on one thing, and still have not finished it. Break up big projects into small successes to help you feel motivated and be more effective at work. If you worked on creating a budget for a company all day, think of it as all the small steps you did to create the budget. Maybe you contacted business owners, created spreadsheets, and calculated where money was being wasted, so you actually accomplished three tasks.\\n1. Creating a work checklist or to-do list can help you stay on track at work. Limit how many items are on your to-do list so you don’t stress yourself out. Choose the three most important tasks you need to get done. These are big, important, and crucial tasks that must get done before you do anything else. Fill the rest of your checklist with minor tasks to accomplish if you finish your big tasks. Write your checklist the night before and focus on that coming day only. Be specific in your checklist, break down tasks into smaller chunks, and include time estimates.\\n2. v4-460px-Be-More-Effective-at-Work-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Be-More-Effective-at-Work-Step-2-Version-2.jpg', 'question_id': 1021586, 'answer_choices': [[3, 1, 0, 2], [1, 3, 0, 2], [0, 2, 1, 3], [2, 1, 3, 0]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10215.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Call-911-Step-8-Version-7.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Call-911-Step-2-Version-9.jpg\\n2. To speak with a 911 dispatcher, simply punch in the numbers “9-1-1” on any working phone and stay on the line. You can even use an unactivated cell phone to place the call. 911 works in the US and Canada. If you are in another location, you will need to call a different emergency number. In Australia, dialing 911 will redirect your call to 000. In the United Kingdom it is 999. Text capabilities are growing, but still severely limited. If you need to contact 911, you should still place a call rather than text. If you ordinarily use special access services (like TTY) with your phone, contact your service provider for information about the best way to contact 911 in an emergency.\\n3. 911 is meant to help in situations involving medical emergencies, fires, or crimes in progress. If someone is hurt, injured, or facing another emergency, don’t waste time, but do think about whether or not you need this type of assistance. Times when it makes sense to call 911 include (but are not limited to):'\\nA fire has started and is out of control. A burglary, an assault, or a crime is in progress. There has been a car crash or other accident. Someone is seriously injured (bleeding severely, in shock, etc.). Someone has suffered a medical emergency (like a heart attack, stroke, or seizure).\\n4. v4-460px-Call-911-Step-6-Version-9.jpg\\n5. If you or someone else (like a child) accidentally call 911, don’t hang up the phone. If you just hang up, the dispatcher may assume that an actual emergency is going on and send assistance. Instead, stay on the line and calmly tell the dispatcher that the call was a mistake.\\n6. v4-460px-Call-911-Step-4-Version-9.jpg\\n7. You should always stay on the line until the dispatcher tells you it’s ok to hang up. They may give you instructions about what to do. Follow these carefully--they can prevent further problems, and even save your life (or someone else’s).

If you don't already have an active account with a brokerage firm, compare the online brokers available and find one that best suits your investment goals and has a wide variety of preferred stock available. Explore the broker's online trading platform and choose one that you find easy to use. If you're new to investing, you're better off to go with a broker who has plenty of resources for beginners. If you're particularly interested in buying preferred stock, check the range that the broker has available before committing to a firm. You may want to do a little research on preferred stocks and make a list of the ones you're particularly interested in, so you can make sure shares will be available through the broker you choose.\\n4. Most brokerage firms offer 2 basic types of investment accounts: cash accounts and margin accounts. Margin accounts differ from cash accounts in that you can borrow money from the brokerage to make an initial stock purchase. The securities in your account serve as collateral for that loan. If you're a beginning investor, you're typically better off choosing a cash account. Brokerage firms may not even offer margin accounts unless you are an experienced investor or are willing to fund your account with a significant amount of money.\\n5. If you've decided to go with an online broker, you typically can complete your application to open your account online. Information you provide about your identity, employment, and income may be subject to additional verification. New account forms also will ask you for the name and contact information for a trusted contact person.

Tell yourself over and over that the feelings you are experiencing are only temporary. Say to yourself that you can get through this situation and everything will work out fine in the end. If you are upset due to work issues, and maybe it’s a regular thing, remind yourself that you can look for other opportunities in which you will be happy and successful. If something outside of work in your personal life is upsetting you, try to separate your personal life from work. Focus on your work and promise yourself you'll deal with the personal issue as soon as you leave for the day. Ignore phone calls or texts that aren't work-related so you won't get upset.

Do not think about whatever it is that is making you upset. Focus all of your attention on something else. The key is to think of something that is very specific and detailed. Think about a happy memory and all of the sights, sounds, and smells that you experienced during that time. List-making can be helpful as well. Go over your grocery list, a recipe, driving directions, or your family’s birthdays. List all the words you can think of for a particular letter. For instance, for the letter A, “apple, ant, artichoke, always” and so on. Try counting backwards from 100.\\n4. Some people become anxious before group meetings, evaluations, or presentations.

If you find that you are a bit smelly, hop in the shower if you have the time. Body odor is created by bacteria that cause you to smell, so rinsing your body (and the part that smells worst in particular) can help to get rid of the smell quickly. However, it\\'s important to use soap or an antibacterial detergent when you wash yourself, rather than just rinsing with water. When you shower, be sure to use a cleansing soap to lather up your underarms, groin area, and feet, along with any other problem areas you may have.\\n2. v4-460px-Eliminate-Body-Odor-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Eliminate-Body-Odor-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\\n4.

To use hand sanitizer as a relief from body odor:\\nSquirt a small amount of hand sanitizer into your hand. Use your hand to rub the sanitizer onto your armpits. The sanitizer will help to fight the bacteria that are causing you to smell.\\n5. Sweating isn\\'t bad for you (unless it\\'s in excess and indicative of a larger problem) so you don\\'t want to eliminate it entirely. Sweating serves the very utilitarian purpose of cooling your body down, but you can manage your sweating so that it doesn\\'t happen at inappropriate times. Deodorant covers up the smell, or eliminates it entirely, while not getting rid of the moisture itself. Some deodorants last longer than others. If you are looking for a quick fix to your body odor problems, apply any deodorant that you can find. If you are looking to stay smelling fresh for longer periods of time, consider investing in a quality deodorant.\\n6. If you\\'d rather not use store-bought products, try using some natural remedies to solve your body odor problem quickly. Vinegar is a natural antiseptic that can help kill bacteria or fungi in your problems areas (like your feet or your underarms). Spritz some white or apple cider on those areas and then wipe your skin dry. You can also dilute vodka with water and spritz it on your underarms. This was famously described by Joan Rivers as an \"old Broadway trick\" that she herself uses. If vinegar isn\\'t really your thing, you can try other natural sterilizers like tea tree oil or witch hazel, both of which have a similar effect to that of vinegar.\\n7. v4-460px-Eliminate-Body-Odor-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\\n8. v4-460px-Eliminate-Body-Odor-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n9.

In some cases, your physician may determine that the best method for removing a mole is to “burn” it off of your skin. This does not involve applying flame to the mole, but rather carefully using a special medical device to deliver an electrical current to cauterize and remove the mole. This method might take several treatments to fully remove larger moles, since the electrical current only burns off a thin layer of skin.\\n2. v4-460px-Remove-a-Raised-Mole-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Remove-a-Raised-Mole-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n4.

If the mole isn’t bothering you, you might consider just leaving it alone; however, you might consider removing the mole if: \\nIt rubs against clothing. It gets caught in jewelry. You consider it unsightly. It causes you to feel stress, anxiety, or embarrassment.\\n5. A mole can also be carefully shaved off of your skin by a skilled surgeon.

The 16th century scientist Galileo Galilei is considered one of the founders of modern science. His research into the mechanics of falling objects and moving projectiles led to his formulation of the first modern theory of relativity, and raised the question known as \"the problem of relativity.\" So how to understand the problem of relativity? Imagine two people observing the same event. For example, two people at a baseball game sitting on opposite sides of the stadium watch the batter hit a home run. The time of the home run will be the same will be the same for both observers while the distance from them will differ. Both fans witnessed the same event relative to each other.

Since Isaac Newton\\'s time, scientists theorized that the universe was filled with a medium they called ether. Light and radio waves traveled through the ether in the same manner as sound waves travel through the air. By the 19th century scientists had worked out ways to measure the properties of the ether, and hoped to create a theory describing the universe. Measure the light. In 1887, physicists Albert Michelson and Edward Morley attempted to prove the existence of the ether using an instrument designed by Michelson known as an interferometer, consisting of a half-silvered glass plate, two mirrors, and a telescope. By aiming a beam at the glass plate, the beam would be split and the two beams would reach the two mirrors at different times, depending on which direction they were traveling with respect to the ether. The unexpected result was both beams reached the mirrors at the same time, failing to prove the existence of the ether. Michelson regarded his experiment as a failure. But it would be a key piece in the work of a young clerk in the Swiss Patent Office.', 'question_id': 10218459, 'answer_choices': [[1, 0, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3, 0], [3, 2, 0, 1], [3, 1, 0, 2]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10218591.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Students need to know what the problem is asking if they’re going to solve it, but recognizing the question is hard. It’s easy to get hung up on the numbers! Rewrite a basic word problem without the numbers, then ask students to determine what it’s asking. You may need to do this several times for students to understand. Your sample problem might look like this: “Sarah is buying pizza for her slumber party. If each pizza has a certain number of slices and she knows how many guests are coming, how can she estimate the number of pizzas she needs. What other information might she need to arrive at the answer?” Your students should point out that Sarah would need to know how many pieces of pizza her guests will eat on average. She could then multiple that number of slices by the number of guests. To get the number of pizzas, she’d then divide the total number of slices by the number of slices in a pizza.\\n1. v4-460px-Teach-Word-Problems-Step-2.jpg\\n2. Students must be able to understand what the problem is saying in order to know what it's asking. Similarly, they won't be able to arrive at the answer unless they know how to do the required math processes. For example, students who can only add numbers should be given word problems that only require addition.\\n3. Without proper context, some students may view word problems as unnecessarily complicated. However, they’re actually intended to help students use math to solve real world problems, such as building a fence, buying enough food for a party, or adjusting a recipe. The math is still the same, but the way the problem is presented is more relevant to real life. Ask students to work with a partner or group to identify ways that they might use math in real life. Next, have them turn that situation into a math-based story. For example, they might say they use math when dividing into teams at recess.

The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain, making up 85% of its weight, and the cerebral cortex is its outermost layer. Because of both its size and its importance, the cerebrum should be the first part of the brain you study. The cerebral cortex is responsible for all of your higher thought processes, such as speech and decision-making. Because of this, it’s arguably the single most important part of the human brain. The cerebral cortex is made up of 4 lobes: the frontal lobe (which controls cognition and higher thinking), the parietal lobe (which processes sensory information relating to taste and touch), the temporal lobe (which processes auditory information), and the occipital lobe (which processes visual information. Note that the cerebrum is divided into 2 hemispheres, the left and the right. These hemispheres correspond to activity on the different sides of your body.\\n1. v4-460px-Study-the-Brain-Step-2.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Study-the-Brain-Step-4.jpg\\n3. Your brain isn’t composed of one single type of tissue; instead, there are two principal tissues at work in the brain: grey matter and white matter. Learn the different ways these two tissue types function to round out your knowledge of the brain’s anatomy. Grey matter is primarily involved in analyzing information, whereas white matter conducts that information between grey areas. A key difference between grey and white matter is that grey matter contains far more cell bodies than white matter does. The ratio of grey matter to white matter in the brain continually fluctuates as humans age.\\n4. The brainstem serves an important connecting role between your cerebrum and spinal cord. Additionally, it plays a critical role in controlling the heart, breathing, and consciousness. The brainstem includes nerve fibers that carry signals between your brain and the rest of your body. In other words, it’s responsible for helping turn thoughts in your cerebral cortex into bodily actions. The brainstem also supplies some of the cranial nerves to the face and head.', 'question_id': 10218758, 'answer_choices': [[3, 2, 1, 0, 4], [0, 1, 4, 2, 3], [3, 4, 2, 1, 0], [4, 3, 0, 1, 2]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10219245.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

If you anticipate needing equipment such as projectors, microphones, or a sound system, make sure to secure those necessities well in advance. Talk with your school’s administrative office about reserving the equipment you need for the date of the assembly. Some schools may require a particular advanced notice period (e.g., at least 2 weeks) for reserving AV equipment. Check with the appropriate office at your school to find out how far in advance to put in your request.\\n3. Once you have your theme squared away and have enlisted a speaker, sit down with teachers and other staff members to plan out the details. Keep notes during the meeting, or ask someone else to do so. In addition to coming up with a basic schedule of events, work out a management plan to keep the assembly safe, smooth, and orderly. Take time to discuss issues such as:\\nWhat the themes will be, and how long each part of the assembly will last. What types of space and equipment you will need for the assembly. What the audience’s role in the assembly will be (e.g., will there be time for discussions or question-and-answer sessions?). Whether you anticipate any problems or challenges, such as managing student behavior or providing special accommodations for any guests. What roles different participants will play in the event (e.g., will you have staff and teachers on hand to manage seating and monitor student behavior? Can you assign students to hand out programs?). The logistics of seating the students. For example, you may wish to seat the youngest grades in front, since this will give them better visibility and keep them more engaged. How to handle a potential crisis. For example, how would you evacuate the space most efficiently in case of an emergency?\\n4. Depending on the nature of your assembly, you may have a smaller or larger number of participants. Knowing who will be present at your assembly is important for logistical planning and safety. Make sure your list includes:\\nTeachers and staff who will be attending. Speakers and special guests. Student groups (e.g., individual grades or the entire student body). Parents and other outside attendees.\\n5. v4-460px-Collect-Email-Addresses-Step-17.jpg\\n6. v4-460px-Apply-for-an-Entrepreneurial-Grant-Step-3.jpg\\n7. A school assembly can be a great opportunity to create community spirit among students, teachers, and staff. The content of the assembly must be interesting and relevant to the participants, however. Before you begin organizing your event, consider what you want it to be about. For example, if you’re having an assembly to celebrate Earth Day, you might focus on how students can reduce their carbon footprint. For a first day of school assembly, you could give the students a general introduction to the rules and culture of the school. Try to link the content of the assembly to subjects that your students have some prior knowledge of—e.g., a unit they have recently been working on in class. This will make it feel more engaging and relevant to them.\\n8. You will need at least 1 person to be a presenter at the assembly. Start working on recruiting someone as early as possible, since you will need to schedule a date that is convenient for them and give them plenty of time to prepare. Have a conversation with your speaker ahead of time about the theme of the assembly and what role you want them to play in the event. Your speaker could be a member of the school staff (e.g., a teacher or administrator), a student, or even a special guest (such as an author, researcher, or local celebrity). For example, if you’re holding an assembly to celebrate Black History Month, you might invite a prominent member of the local African American community (such as your local NAACP chapter president) to speak. If you can, start reaching out to speakers at least 2 months in advance. This will give them plenty of time to clear their schedule and prepare a presentation.\\n9. Once you have all your details locked down, you can design some formal programs for your assembly. If any students or staff members at your school have an interest in graphic design, they might enjoy being involved in designing the program. Your program should include information such as: \\nThe name and theme of the assembly (e.g., “Fresh Starts and New Beginnings: Celebrating a New School Year at Wooster Elementary”). The date, time, and location of the assembly. The schedule of events at the assembly. Any other important details, such as information about how attendees can request special accommodations.\\n10. v4-460px-Achieve-Short-Term-Goals-Step-4-Version-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10220440, 'answer_choices': [[3, 6, 1, 9, 5, 7, 8, 4, 2, 0, 10], [7, 4, 6, 5, 9, 8, 10, 0, 1, 3, 2], [7, 6, 8, 10, 4, 0, 3, 5, 2, 1, 9], [9, 3, 4, 10, 7, 6, 1, 8, 5, 2, 0]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10220590.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Oysters, crab, and shrimp, in particular, are good dietary sources of zinc.

If you want simple designs to appear imprinted on the bottle, use foam stickers to cut the designs. Simple shapes or letters work best. If you are using letters in your design, remember to cut them in reverse. To complete the process:\\nInsert the foam stickers into the bottle. If the neck of the bottle is narrow, use a utility knife to carefully feed the sticker into the jar. Once your sticker is in the jar, use a pencil or any other long, narrow object to press the sticker against the side of the jar. Wrap your bottle in a plastic bag. Tape the bag to the neck of the jar to keep it in place. Set the wrapped bottle in a tarped area or in a box. Put on some gloves, while you’re at it. These measures will help you avoid getting paint anywhere you don’t want it. Insert the spray paint nozzle into the jar. Spray a layer of paint into the jar or bottle.

Bean flours are made from a variety of ground-up types of beans, including garbanzo, navy, pinto, soy, and fava. This gives the flour a rich, complex flavor, which works particularly well in heavy and intensely-flavored baked goods like gingerbread and chocolate cupcakes or brownies. You can bake with a bean flour blend on its own. It also works well when blended with most other gluten-free flours.\\n1. Almond flour—made from ground-up nuts—contains no gluten. It has a pleasant, nutty taste. It’s best to blend flours when you’re baking with almond flour. Use almond flour for ¼ of the amount of flour called for, and use another gluten-free flour (such as tapioca flour) for ¾ of the called-for amount in order to achieve the right texture. Avoid using 100% almond flour in baked goods, or the quality and consistency of the product may suffer. Since almonds are tough nuts, some grinds of almond flour can be a little gritty. To avoid using a gritty flour, look for a fine-milled flour. Also be aware that nut-based flours have a tendency to brown quickly in the oven. While this won’t alter the flavor of baked goods, it can make them appear overcooked.\\n2. v4-460px-Pick-an-Alternative-to-Wheat-Flour-Step-2.jpg\\n3. Quinoa flour is a great option for a healthy gluten-free flour. It contains all 9 of the amino acids and is a complete protein in itself. Quinoa flour comes in 2 varieties: white and red. Red quinoa flour has a deep, rich flavor, making it ideal for hearty, sticky desserts. White quinoa flour is lighter and better suited to desserts that have citrus flavors. The flour itself has a slight almond taste. Like tapioca flour, use quinoa flour for about ¼ of your flour blend. Avoid using quinoa flour as the only flour in a baked good. Blend it with other nutty flours like amaranth or rice flour.\\n4. Tapioca flour is thick and heavy and gives baked goods a slightly chewy texture. Depending on what you’re using the flour for, this can be a desirable trait. For example, some heavy breads (like French breads, Italian breads, or sourdough) would benefit from a chewy texture. If you’re baking with tapioca flour, use it for about ¼ to ½ of your flour blend. Blend it with other fine-grained gluten-free flours like almond flour or quinoa flour. Tapioca also works well as a thickening agent.

The best and most basic way to avoid sitting for too long is to stop sitting every once in a while. Stand up from your chair and talk a brief walk once every hour to break up a prolonged sitting session. It’s sometimes recommended that you take a break from sitting every 30 minutes. Although this will definitely help you avoid harmful impacts to your health, it may also stifle your productivity. If you have a smartphone, set a reminder to go off every hour to help remind you to take a break. Even if you don’t walk around, you should at least briefly stretch your arms and legs before sitting back down from your break.\\n2. Make taking an evening stroll part of your everyday routine. This will discourage you from sitting all the way through to bedtime and will also allow you to reap the health benefits of walking more every day. Aim for a 30-minute walk for maximum health benefit. If you can’t devote this much time to your evening stroll, try to walk at least for at least 5 minutes. If you have a family or a dog, take them with you! You’ll be more motivated to walk if you’re not alone and the rest of your family will get the same health benefits as you!\\n3. v4-460px-Avoid-the-Dangers-of-Sitting-Step-4.jpg\\n4. Whenever you’re doing something that doesn’t require you to be sitting, take that opportunity to stand up and walk around a little. Standing while on the phone or watching TV will prevent you from casually falling into a prolonged sitting session. For an even better impact on your health, pace while talking on the phone instead of just standing. If the idea of standing to watch TV sounds boring, you can also do some stretches, a light workout, or other mobility work while you’re watching.

Although researchers are not sure why, sipping tea every day has been shown to have a positive impact on cortisol levels in the body. Drinking more black or green tea every day may help you relax and calm your nerves naturally.

Depending on whether you want to boil the noodles, you can purchase them dry or already cooked. Fresh noodles are already cooked, whereas dry noodles will need to be boiled before serving. If the shop does not sell misua noodles, you can use Japanese somen noodles as a replacement. Fresh misua noodles do not need to be boiled and generally have an expiration date of several days or weeks after purchase.

As you rinse and scrub the shells, give each one a quick visual inspection. If you notice any large cracks, chipped areas, or particularly stinky shells, get rid of them. You only want to provide your hermit crabs with the best shells. Shells you get from the beach might be a little stinky, but if they smell really strongly, something might have died inside.\\n3. Hermit crabs poop in their shells and they get filled with sand, substrate, and other gritty things, or if you found your new shells on the beach, there could be other things inside of them.

If you have a lot of shells, work in batches of 10 so that the rinsed away grime doesn’t just end up on the shells at the bottom of the colander.\\n4. You can buy new shells for your hermit crabs at the pet store or online, or you can find them on the beach. Never use a painted or glossed shell—they’re toxic to hermit crabs. If you do collect shells from the beach, make sure there aren’t living occupants inside them before you take them home.

You should also be able to feel bones near the base of your cat\\'s tail. While there should be a small layer of fat protecting this area, you should be able to feel the outlines of his bones without much effort. If you cannot easily feel bones here, your cat may be overweight.\\n2. Many cats have a saggy bit of flesh that hangs down between their back legs. If your cat is otherwise bony, this small pouch of skin is unlikely to be an indication of a weight problem. This skin flap is referred to as the \"primordial pouch\" and its purpose is to protect the stomach during fights with other cats. Cats often kick with their back legs when angry, and this flap of skin protects your cat from such attacks. Many cats will develop a primordial pouch at some point in their lives and it is not necessarily an indicator of feline obesity. However, excess fat may be stored in your cat\\'s primordial pouch if he is overweight. If he shows other symptoms of obesity, check his pouch. It should hang loose and be mostly comprised of skin. If the pouch seems to be filling out with fat, this can be an indicator of obesity.\\n3. You can start determining if your cat\\'s overweight by looking at him. Examining your cat from above and from the side should help you determine if his weight is a problem. Look at your cat from above. The area between his ribs and hips should move inward slightly, creating a clearly defined waist. If there is no waist or if his waist is wider than either his hips or ribs, your cat may be overweight. You should also look at your cat from the side. Cats who are at a healthy weight have what is called an abdominal tuck. This means the area just behind their ribs should have a smaller diameter than the chest.

Make an appointment with your doctor to evaluate your calcium levels. You'll need to talk with your doctor about your diet, so that they can estimate how much calcium you intake already. You may also need to get a blood test to check your current calcium levels. It's important that your total daily calcium intake stays below the suggested limit, which is based on both sex and age. Too much calcium can cause a variety of health problems, including an increased risk for heart disease. For men ages 19-50 years old, the maximum daily allowance is 2,500 mg.

David Nazarian, MD\\t\\t\\tDiplomate, American Board of Internal Medicine\\t\\t\\t\\tDid You Know? Most people get enough calcium through their diet and don't need a calcium supplement, although older people often do benefit from a calcium supplement to support their bone health. To determine whether you need to be taking calcium, as well as the amount you should take, ask your doctor for a blood test to check your calcium levels. Normal calcium levels should be between 8.6 and 10.2 mg/dL.\\n1. All supplements contain differing levels of elemental calcium. Since this is the type of calcium that actually absorbs into your body, it’s important to choose a supplement with enough to suit your needs. Look for this information on the supplement facts label on the back of the bottle. For example, your calcium carbonate supplement might contain 450 mg of elemental calcium.\\n2. v4-460px-Avoid-Problems-with-Calcium-Supplements-Step-2.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Avoid-Problems-with-Calcium-Supplements-Step-4.jpg\\n4. Although supplements are a quick, effective way to boost your calcium levels, it’s always best to eat a nutrient-rich diet. Incorporate foods that are naturally high in calcium, such as soft-boned fish, into your diet along with calcium-fortified products, such as milk or orange juice. Vegetables with dark colors, such as broccoli, also have boosted calcium levels. Some cereals, soy products, and juices are also fortified with extra calcium. Their ingredient labels usually note this under calcium percentages. To track the calcium in your diet, you can download an app. The Calcium Calculator app offered by the International Osteoporosis Foundation is one option.

Cooking dead crabs will result in a mushy and undesirable texture and could give you food poisoning.\", 'question_id': 10232151, 'answer_choices': [[4, 1, 0, 3, 2], [3, 4, 0, 1, 2], [4, 2, 1, 0, 3], [2, 4, 1, 3, 0]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1023275.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Make-Hoppers-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n1. This recipe replaces slower methods of fermentation with yeast, which only takes about 2 hours to give the batter the right consistency and flavor for cooking. Hoppers made this way do taste different than hoppers made with toddy or baking soda, but they are still tasty and you'll save a lot of preparation time. This is also the best recipe to follow if you don't have a food processor or strong blender, since all the ingredients are easy to stir together by hand.\\n2. Two or three drops of oil should be enough for a single hopper. Twirl the pan to make sure the oil covers the sides, or use a cloth to apply it evenly. Some people prefer not to use any oil at all, but it helps prevent your hopper from sticking to the pan.\\n3. Once the yeast mixture is foamy, transfer it to a large bowl containing 3 cups (700 mL) rice flour and 1 tsp (5 mL) salt. Stir this together. Use a bowl that can hold about 3 quarts (3 liters), since the batter will expand.\\n4. A butter knife or other thin, flat utensil is good for removing the thin, crispy edge from the pan without breaking it. Once it's unstuck, use a spatula to transfer the hopper onto a plate. You can stack hoppers on top of each other as you cook them. If you are making a large number of hoppers (double or triple recipe) and want to keep them warm, place them in the oven at minimum temperature settings or with just the pilot light on.\\n5. v4-460px-Make-Hoppers-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n6. v4-460px-Make-Hoppers-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n7. v4-460px-Make-Hoppers-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\\n8. v4-460px-Make-Hoppers-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\\n9. v4-460px-Make-Hoppers-Step-12.jpg\\n10. Now that the yeast is active, it will continue to ferment the sugars in the batter. This will make the batter expand into an airier mixture, and add additional flavor as well. Cover the bowl and let it sit on the counter for about 2 hours. The dough will expand to about twice its size by the time it's ready. Yeast works more quickly at warmer temperature, or if it is still relatively new. Check on it after an hour to see if the batter has already expanded enough.\\n11. They are excellent for balancing out spicy curries or sambols. Because of the coconut flavor, they pair especially well with dinner dishes containing coconut.\\n12. If you like, crack an egg directly over the center of the hopper. You might want to taste your first hopper plain first before you decide whether you'd like to try it with eggs. If each person is eating several hoppers, an egg for every hopper is probably too much. Consider 0-2 per person depending on their preference.\", 'question_id': 1023275, 'answer_choices': [[1, 0, 3, 6, 10, 5, 2, 8, 12, 7, 4, 9, 11], [2, 8, 9, 0, 5, 1, 10, 12, 4, 11, 3, 6, 7], [6, 5, 8, 10, 0, 9, 2, 1, 3, 4, 12, 11, 7], [0, 4, 7, 3, 10, 1, 12, 2, 5, 11, 9, 8, 6]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1023281.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Before you can work through negative emotions, you need to identify them. Imagine you’re writing a report on your emotions and you need to be as detailed as possible. You shouldn’t only think about type of emotion, but the intensity of that emotion, too. “Upset” is a pretty vague way to describe your emotional state. Dig deeper to find a more specific identifier, like “deeply disappointed.”\\nRather than saying you feel “good,” you could describe yourself as feeling “ecstatic” or “relaxed.”\\nRemember that you are not your emotions. An emotion is a temporary condition, much like a weather system passing through. Instead of saying “I am angry,” say “I feel angry right now.”\\n1. v4-459px-Be-Less-Emotional-in-a-Relationship-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\\n2. v4-459px-Be-Less-Emotional-in-a-Relationship-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\\n3. Once you’ve identified and observed your emotions, it’s time for a little detective work. Take care not to project feelings arising from your own issues onto your partner. Ask yourself a few questions to determine where the feelings are coming from. For example, what exactly triggered your reaction? Are you mad because you feel disrespected by your partner, or does your anger have more to do with a rough day at work? If you’re feeling jealous, ask yourself if your jealousy is the result of past hurts. Think about your relationships with family, friends, and exes. Do any wounds from these relationships explain your current feelings of jealousy?\\n4. If you struggle with your mood or experience extreme emotional lows or highs, there may be an underlying physical reason.

A person struggling with depression may feel like it defines them and controls their life. Using language that puts the person first when describing depression or other mental health conditions takes the emphasis off the condition and puts it on the person. This can help them feel more confident and remind them that they are separate from their depression. For example, instead of saying “I’m depressed,” encourage them to say something like “I have depression” or “I’m dealing with depression.”\\n2. Let them know that they can trust you and that they can be honest without fear of judgment. They might not want to talk or ask for anything, but assuring them that you’re there can still offer comfort. If you notice they seem sad or can’t get out of bed, try saying, “You are so important to me. Is there anything I can do to help? I know we can find a way to help you feel better.”\\nEven if they don’t say anything, sitting next to them or holding their hand are simple, important gestures. While it’s important to ask them how they’re doing from time to time, especially when they’re clearly in distress or having a low period, resist the urge to “check in” all the time. Reminding your loved one of their depression regularly can be counter-productive.\\n3. v4-460px-Live-with-Someone-Who-Is-Depressed-Step-4.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Live-with-Someone-Who-Is-Depressed-Step-8.jpg\\n5. Don’t push them too hard, but encourage them to get out of the house with you. Try asking them to go for a walk around the block or for a bike ride. Think of their favorite hobbies, activities, and games, and see if you can convince them to get active. Try asking, “How about we get some fresh air? Will you go for a little walk with me?” You could say, “You’ve always loved gardening. How about I take you to the garden center, and we can plant some flowers together?”\\nInactivity is a common symptom and can prolong depressive episodes. If you can’t get your loved one to leave their bed or room, try opening the blinds or curtains to let in sunlight. You could bring an activity to them, like cards or a board game.\\n6. v4-460px-Live-with-Someone-Who-Is-Depressed-Step-6.jpg\\n7. If your loved one has a doctor or therapist, report any threats of suicide to them promptly. If possible, stay with your loved one, tell them that they’re important and you love them, and assure them that they don't have to struggle with this by themselves. If you believe your loved one is in danger of harming themselves or others, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or encourage them to call.

Be it over the phone or face-to-face, this is the most seamless transition into asking for a review.

Making your own hide house from wood is a great low-cost option if you are a skilled builder.

In addition to their individual nesting boxes, a larger shared nesting box will allow your chinchillas to soothe each other during moments of fear or stress.\\n2. Both related and unrelated chinchillas inhabiting the same cage should be monitored for signs of cagemate aggression, particularly around the time of sexual maturity. Watch for aggressive behaviors to make sure your cagemate chinchillas are not a danger to each other, as chinchilla infighting can result in serious injuries or death. Signs of aggression in chinchillas include: teeth chattering, growling, and urine spraying.\\n3. Chinchillas will gnaw on anything, and can easily chew through a plastic cage.

Athletes who participate in intense physical activity are at risk for magnesium deficiency, but only when they have been exerting themselves for a long period of time, such as during a triathlon or marathon. While you only lose approximately 15 mg of magnesium through sweat in an average day, your losses would be more significant if you sweat more often – whether due to high-intensity activity or significant periods of time outdoors in high heat and humidity. An athlete who is participating in a long event, such as a marathon or triathlon, would be a good candidate for a magnesium supplement, provided they aren't doing anything else that inhibits their body's absorption of magnesium. However, most of the time a balanced diet it enough to keep their magnesium levels in check.\\n2. v4-460px-Tell-if-You-Are-Low-in-Magnesium-Step-4.jpg\\n3. There are many symptoms of low magnesium. Unfortunately, a lot of these symptoms, such as anxiety, irritability, memory problems, and muscle weakness, are also symptoms of other conditions or problems. As with your energy level, carefully eliminate any other reason you're experiencing these symptoms to the fullest extent possible. For example, you may be anxious or irritable because you have a significant project due for work or school that you're worried about. That might not have anything to do with your magnesium levels. These symptoms may also signal more serious conditions that you should have checked out by your doctor. For example, anxiety may be caused by heart disease, diabetes, respiratory disorders (such as asthma), or irritable bowel syndrome.\\n4. v4-460px-Tell-if-You-Are-Low-in-Magnesium-Step-6.jpg\\n5. If you've eliminated as many other causes for your symptoms as possible, and are still concerned that your magnesium levels are low, your doctor can perform a blood test. There is little risk to a blood test, apart from a slight prick when the needle is inserted. Once the blood is taken, it typically must be sent to a lab for processing. Normal blood magnesium levels are between 1.7 to 2.2 mg/dL (0.85 to 1.10 mmol/L). Some labs use different ranges. Your doctor will go over your specific test results with you and tell you what they mean. Low magnesium can be a symptom of some serious health conditions, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, or ulcerative colitis. If your tests show low magnesium, your doctor may want to perform additional tests.\\n6. Symptoms of low magnesium include fatigue, anxiety, loss of appetite, muscle weakness, memory problems, and nausea. If you have extremely low magnesium along with other health problems, you may notice more serious symptoms, such as tremors, difficulty swallowing, or a rapid or irregular heartbeat. If your symptoms are more severe, or if they prevent you from doing your usual daily activities, seek medical attention as soon as possible.\", 'question_id': 10235166, 'answer_choices': [[4, 0, 1, 5, 3, 6, 2], [1, 5, 2, 6, 4, 3, 0], [1, 6, 4, 5, 0, 3, 2], [6, 0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 1]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10236311.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Fix-Imbalanced-Breast-Sizes-Step-4.jpg\\n1.

Talk to your healthcare professional about breast surgery, as they will be able to guide you through your options, and help you to make an informed choice. You will talk about your medical history, your reasons for wanting surgery, and the possible procedures. Scarring is an unavoidable risk that is involved with breast surgery. Other risks include nipple sensitivity and a lower blood supply to the nipples. If you are planning on breastfeeding in the future, talk to your surgeon about how the surgery will affect breastfeeding in the future. This will depend on if your milk ducts are cut during surgery, and how much breast milk you will be able to produce.

This surgery is when fat from a different area of your body is added to the smaller breast, to make it the same size as the other. This will help your breasts to look and feel more alike. A fat transfer augmentation usually takes around 3 hours to complete, and you can go home on the same day provided that you have a support person. Women usually take up to 1 week off work after this surgery. The risks associated with a fat transfer augmentation are the formation of lumps and cysts, or the fat graft not surviving. Your surgeon will run you through all of the possible risks of the surgery to give you the best information possible. A fat transfer augmentation is considered a more natural option because it doesn’t use implants or silicone, but rather your own fat tissue, which will make your breasts feel more “normal”.', 'question_id': 10236311, 'answer_choices': [[1, 2, 3, 0], [3, 2, 1, 0], [1, 3, 2, 0], [1, 0, 2, 3]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10236750.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Tire-Flip-Step-12.jpg\\n1.

If you are traveling for vacation, to sight-see, or just for fun, travel underneath the “Support for the Cuban People” category. Essentially, “Support for the Cuban People” means that you are only supporting local businesses and will not patronize any establishments that give money to or are run by the government of Cuba.

Avoid traveling to Cuba from August to October to avoid hurricane season and unpredictable weather. “Winter” in Cuba takes place from December to March, with temperatures in the 80 °F (27 °C) range, and summer extends from June to September, with June and July being the preferable “beach life” months as the chance of hurricanes is much lower. Peak temperatures in the summer will reach about 85 °F (29 °C), and wintertime temperatures will be around 75 °F (24 °C).', 'question_id': 10237498, 'answer_choices': [[5, 0, 2, 6, 1, 4, 3], [5, 3, 4, 6, 1, 0, 2], [5, 0, 3, 4, 2, 6, 1], [1, 3, 6, 2, 0, 5, 4]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10237656.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Complete-a-Wellness-Challenge-Step-2.jpg\\n1. If you're tied up with work, school, kids, or other responsibilities, it might be tough to find the time to walk long distances or exercise every day. If you opt for a challenge with goals that suit your busy schedule, you'll be more likely to make it all the way to the end. For example, a complicated 30-day diet with lots of restrictions might require more trips to the grocery store and meal prep than your schedule allows. Instead, you could simply cap your daily calories to 2500 (or to your specific recommended value), or cut out foods like ice cream, red meat, and fast food.\\n2. To set yourself up for success, go for a wellness challenge with clear, realistic goals. It's okay to be ambitious and push yourself, as long as your goals are within the realm of possibility. You'll be more likely to stick with a challenge that's within your abilities. For example, if you're not used to running, a month-long, 5k-a-day running challenge probably isn't the best choice. Instead, you could aim to walk briskly for an hour per day, walk at least 5,000 steps a day, or try to jog daily for at least 1 minute longer than the prior day. Additionally, make sure your goals are safe. Check with your doctor before doing a fitness challenge if you're not used to exercise. Avoid dieting challenges that provide inadequate nutrition or with weight loss goals greater than 1 to 2 pounds (0.45 to 0.91 kg) per week.\\n3. v4-460px-Complete-a-Wellness-Challenge-Step-4.jpg\", 'question_id': 10237656, 'answer_choices': [[0, 2, 3, 1], [0, 3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 0, 1], [2, 0, 1, 3]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10237853.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

If you favor a smoothie instead of cereal, muesli makes for a great addition or topping, either before or after mixing it up.

The most basic and common way to eat muesli is just as you would eat a bowl of cereal, adding about a half cup of your favorite milk to an equal helping of muesli in a bowl. Instead of milk, try your favorite brand of plain yoghurt (or flavoured if your prefer extra sweetness) for probiotic benefits and a different flavor and texture. Try heating the milk, then letting the muesli soak for a few minutes in the hot milk to soften it slightly, making it a bit more like oatmeal. You can also pour cold milk over the cereal in a microwave safe bowl, then heat the whole mixture in the microwave. Like cereal, it's also great to snack on all by itself. Just snack on it like granola.\\n5. One of the things some people like about muesli is the thing some people don't like about muesli. The raw oats offer a different texture and nutritional benefits not offered by cooked oatmeal or granola, but also offer the possibility of cooking into a simple porridge, just like basic raw oats. Boil as much milk and water as you want to yield in cooked muesli, then add half as much muesli to the pot. If you want a cup of cooked muesli, in other words, boil a half cup of water and a half cup of milk, then add a half cup of raw muesli to it.

Choose a cleanser that is meant for sensitive skin. Harsh cleansers may irritate your skin and cause or intensify your existing acne.

These will enable you to adjust the height of your keyboard and monitor to a more comfortable position. Adjust your monitor arm to eye level or slightly below. If you notice yourself craning your neck while working try raising the arm slightly. Adjust the keyboard platform so that your arms form a 90° angle. When you lower the desk to sit down ensure that you re-adjust the keyboard platform to a comfortable height.', 'question_id': 10240800, 'answer_choices': [[2, 3, 1, 0], [1, 0, 3, 2], [0, 2, 1, 3], [1, 0, 2, 3]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10240801.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Visit-Central-Park-Step-2.jpg\\n1. If you live in the city or if you have a rental car, it might make sense to drive there. You can work around your schedule and don’t have to trust someone else to get you there safely. Cars are not allowed in Central Park proper, but you can drive around the perimeter. Street parking may be difficult, but there are many parking garages nearby. Metered parking in the area is $3.50 per hour. Ramps are around $20.00 for the first hour, and up to $40.00 for an entire day.\\n2. v4-460px-Visit-Central-Park-Step-4.jpg\\n3. Central Park opens to the public at 6:00am and closes at 1:00am, and there is no fee to get in.

Supportive shoes are especially important when you are doing an activity that causes your foot to strike against the ground, such as walking or running.

As the name suggests, floating jerkbaits do not sink into the water until they’re jerked. So, it’s very unlikely that a floating jerkbait will get snarled up in weeds, shrubs, or obstacles under the water. Floating jerkbaits are also great for catching bass in the top 3 feet (0.91 m) of water.\\n1. v4-460px-Fish-a-Jerkbait-Step-4.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Fish-a-Jerkbait-Step-2.jpg\\n3. In slightly clouded water, bass won’t be able to see the colors of the bait as clearly. In fact, a bright chartreuse bait may draw the attention of bass in clouded water better than a natural-colored bait would. So, break out the bright colors when fishing in clouded water. Alternately, if the bass just aren’t striking at your natural color baits in clear water, switch things up and use an artificial-colored bait. Fish can be finicky, and what color or jerkbait they strike may vary from day to day. Also fish with artificial-colored jerkbaits in summer. The bright colors will catch the fish’s eye. Since bass are more energetic in summer, they’ll come investigate the bait.\\n4. Once you’ve gained some experience fishing with floating jerkbaits, use can move on to more demanding sinking baits. These baits are weighted down so that they’ll sink at a certain speed and then rise up when jerked. Different sinking baits contain different amounts of weight so they’ll sink at different rates. Try a few different weights to find out which works best for your current fishing conditions. For example, if you’re fishing in summer and bass are hiding out deep in the lake, a fast-sinking jerkbait will take your bait to the fish more quickly than a slow-sinking bait.', 'question_id': 10241405, 'answer_choices': [[3, 4, 0, 2, 1], [2, 4, 1, 0, 3], [0, 2, 4, 1, 3], [0, 4, 3, 2, 1]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10241795.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Not-Cry-at-a-Funeral-Step-6.jpg\\n1.

Hang a line of medium-sized photos, paintings, or other art in identical frames along the wall for a symmetrical look. This would look good between two windows or two doors. As a rule of thumb, art should be hung at eye level, but not if the ceiling is low. A low ceiling height is considered 8 to 9 feet (2.4 to 2.7 m). If you’re hanging a collection of art, hang it as though it were one piece, as opposed to individual pieces. Pinterest and home decor magazines can provide a lot of inspiration for arranging your wall art, especially if you want to create a gallery wall.\\n1. Print your favorite photographs and hang them at different heights to make an art gallery look in your living room. When grouping 4 or more pieces 1 above the other, the art should be visually balanced on both sides of an imaginary vertical line. So too many larger frames on one side of the imaginary line will unbalance the arrangement. For instance, if there are only large frames on the right side of the arrangement, and only small frames on the left, it would look clumsy. Make sure the art is similar in color scheme, subject matter, or frame style. You should also coordinate the artwork with your living room’s color scheme. You may change the art in your gallery wall over time to accommodate bigger, smaller, or different artwork without it becoming outdated or mismatched. It's okay for your gallery wall to start small and grow over time.

Generally speaking, these are the healthiest standard menu items. However, many McDonald’s menu boards now contain calorie counts, and you can also ask them for additional nutritional information on every menu item. If you really want to eat healthier at McDonald’s, search online for “healthy McDonald’s menu items” before you head to the restaurant. McDonald’s continues to expand their menu offerings in an attempt to appeal to more health-conscious consumers.\\n2. You’ll find many mentions online of McDonald’s so-called “secret menu,” but this really just involves making substitutions or combinations of existing menu items. Search online before heading to the restaurant to find some popular secret menu “hacks.”\\nYou can, for instance, order any burger “Big Mac style,” which means adding lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, and Big Mac sauce to the plain burger. You can also substitute a sesame seed bun on any sandwich. You can also request a “round egg” (a fresh egg cooked in a round form) on any breakfast sandwich instead of getting the scrambled egg sheet that’s made from a powdered egg mix.

Protective plastic sheets can be bought at most hardware stores, usually near their paint section.\\n2. A paint's thickness and viscosity can change at higher heats, so avoid storing paint near a source of heat.

Using your list of monthly expenses, you can establish a monthly budget moving forward. First plan for your fixed expenses (or bills that don’t change per month) such as your rent or mortgage.

Within reason, you should make your girlfriend your number one priority when she's upset and needs your support. How quickly you're there for her might be as important as being there itself and the act of you rushing to her aid lets her know how much she means to you. This, alone, will help her feel better regardless of why she's upset\\nObviously, you won't be able to rush to your girlfriend at the drop of a coin. Most times, you will have to balance the criticality of your current activities and the severity of her emotional distress. If you're at work or school and her situation is dire, you should clear your mind of your responsibilities and give her all the emotional support and caring that you can verbally. Let her know that she is your number one priority and that you will be there physically as soon as you can practically clear your plate.\\n3. The best thing you can do is to become an active listener and let her work through her feelings and come naturally to her own realization/insight. Resist injecting your solution into the process. Instead, facilitate her settling into her own understanding of her emotional quandary. Let her vent while you assume the role of empathizer. Engage in active listening. Make a habit of rephrasing what she's said to you. Make her feelings and articulations be your entire world for the time she talks to you. Empathy cannot happen if you're partly focused on your own thoughts. Even so, you shouldn't be afraid to offer your own feelings, but only if she asks you for them.\\n4. In addition to whatever she is feeling bad about, your girlfriend may feel a new kind of shame in simply showing emotional vulnerability to you. If you think this is the case, you should pull her in close to you and remind her feelings are normal and only to be expected.

You can fold them both together at the same time, or do them one at a time to make them easier to maneuver. Make sure the sleeves are as close to the hook as possible when they’re folded.

Many automotive companies sell special clear-coat protection products that seal and protect your clear coat. To apply the product, simply rub it into the clear coat with a microfiber cloth. Follow the directions printed on the bottle, and apply the clear-coat protection roughly as often as you wash your vehicle. You can purchase clear-coat protection products at any large automotive-supply store. However, you should not opt for the “clear-coat protection” treatment at a car wash.

It's best to use a wig brush, which is designed to remove tangles from wigs. Move the wig brush through the wig, starting at the lower end of the strands and moving up the length of the hair as you brush.

One way to approach this is to think about how the story might be different if it were in a different setting. Would the tone of the story feel the same? Would the events and themes of the story fit in another setting? How are the characters and their beliefs and actions influenced by their historical, cultural, and geographical context? For example, if “Jeeves Takes Charge” took place in 2018, how likely would it be that a young man like Bertie would employ a personal attendant like Jeeves? How would Bertie steal his uncle’s manuscript in an age when most documents are written and sent electronically?\\n1. v4-460px-Analyze-a-Short-Story-Step-8.jpg\\n2. The setting of a story provides atmosphere and helps the action feel more grounded and real. It can also play a significant role in how the plot of the story plays out. Try to identify where, specifically, the story is set, and think about how the author creates the setting. Ask yourself what the setting might mean for the story’s characters and readers, whether it motivates the characters in any way, or what symbolic meaning it might carry. For example, most of “Jeeves Takes Charge” is set at Easeby Hall, a fictional country estate in Shropshire, England. Wodehouse does not describe the setting in great detail, but creates an impression by offering minor details in passing (e.g., Bertie hides behind a suit of armor in his uncle’s library while waiting to steal the manuscript).\\n3. v4-460px-Analyze-a-Short-Story-Step-2.jpg\\n4. Once you’ve written down the basic details, write a paragraph or a couple sentences summarizing what the story is about. It doesn’t need to cover all the plot points—just try to boil it down to the absolute basics. For example, “‘Jeeves Takes Charge’ is about an airheaded young aristocrat (Bertie Wooster) who tries to sabotage the publication of his uncle’s scandalous memoirs in order to please his fiancée. Meanwhile, Bertie’s valet, Jeeves, is scheming to break up Bertie’s engagement.”\\n5. v4-460px-Analyze-a-Short-Story-Step-4.jpg\\n6. In addition to learning about the author’s background, knowing the general historical and geographical context of the story can help you understand it better. Even if the story is set in a different time and place from when/where it was written, the story’s context will inevitably influence the themes, language, tone, and viewpoints presented in the story. Take note of any major social and political issues of the time period, and any popular artistic movements. Major cultural and political shifts are often reflected in short stories, whether purposefully or in a more subtle context. For example, “Jeeves Takes Charge” is set in an English country estate in the 1910s, but it was published in America during the early years of WWI (before America’s involvement in the war). It plays on humorous American stereotypes of the English aristocracy while avoiding references to contemporary historical events.\\n7. Summarizing the story will help you organize your thoughts and ensure that you have a basic understanding of the story. Start your analysis by writing down:\\nThe title of the story. The author’s name. The date of publication. Where the story was originally published (e.g., in an anthology or a literary magazine). For example, “I am analyzing ‘Jeeves Takes Charge’ by P. G. Wodehouse, originally published in the November 18, 1916 edition of The Saturday Evening Post.”\\n8. v4-460px-Analyze-a-Short-Story-Step-6.jpg', 'question_id': 10249506, 'answer_choices': [[3, 4, 8, 2, 5, 7, 0, 6, 1], [6, 2, 7, 4, 5, 3, 0, 1, 8], [7, 8, 3, 1, 6, 0, 2, 4, 5], [7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 2, 1, 0]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10249810.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. The total amount of cards used in a typical Hand and Foot game can exceed 150. A general rule of thumb is to have as many decks as there are players in the game. Once you have all the decks, place them in a pile in the middle in the middle of the table. This central pile of cards is now referred to as the 'stack.' Hand and Foot works best with 2-6 players. Anything beyond 6 players can become unwieldy.\\n1. Each player in turn should grab a pile of cards from the central stack, aiming for 22 cards total.

By making yourself aloof from other human beings, you are building an invisible barrier around yourself that wards off the potential for new relationships and friendships. It can be deceptive to think that you can give help and advice but never need to accept it in return. This ultimately just leads to loneliness and despair as it only serves to isolate you from others. Consider reciprocity, think about times you\\'ve helped others with your own specialties which can give you confidence in asking others for help or advice in their areas of expertise.\\n1. v4-460px-Stop-Thinking-that-Accepting-Help-is-a-Sign-of-Weakness-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\\n2. There are many possible reasons that might be influencing your reluctance to seek help from others. One is your concern about how others view you. Some of the following reasons might be applicable to you:\\nYou may feel that you don\\'t need help, or that any person offering help is threatening your independence. For example, maybe you have had to look out for yourself since an early age due to neglectful parents. Now, you believe suddenly accepting help from others makes you weak. Perhaps, it was instilled in you that an adult or someone your age must take responsibility for himself. As a result, you believe it is socially wrong to ask (or to be a burden) to friends and family for assistance. You may battle with fears of rejection or have a tendency to towards perfectionism. Both motivations can cause you to avoid accepting help for fear of failing or being seen as a failure. If you\\'re a business owner or professional, you may be worried that needing help can demonstrate a lack of professionalism. Consequently, you might feel that someone not handling his own affairs is inferior or incompetent.\\n3. v4-460px-Stop-Thinking-that-Accepting-Help-is-a-Sign-of-Weakness-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n4. Not wanting to show vulnerability can cause you to refrain from asking for help. When you think about it, the emotional exposure required to ask another for help can be quite uncomfortable. However, it is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, researchers declare that vulnerability is at the \"core\" of \"meaningful human experience\". Here\\'s how to open yourself up to vulnerability:\\n\\n Practice mindfulness as a first step towards embracing moments of vulnerability. Gradually take notice of the physical sensations, thoughts, and feelings that accompany vulnerability. Give yourself love and acceptance. Acknowledge that being vulnerable is hard and takes courage. Applaud yourself for the slightest efforts. Know that being open (and vulnerable) to others deepen the connection and intimacy you share. Choose wisely with whom you exercise vulnerability.\\n5. v4-460px-Stop-Thinking-that-Accepting-Help-is-a-Sign-of-Weakness-Step-4-Version-2.jpg', 'question_id': 1024987, 'answer_choices': [[2, 1, 4, 5, 0, 3], [1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 0], [1, 0, 2, 4, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 0, 5, 4]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10250407.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Garlic is recognized for its role in lowering blood pressure, including in pregnant women. Though it’s not a cure, it can help maintain a lower blood pressure. Include fresh or powdered garlic in your recipes, or take a garlic supplement. Always talk to your doctor before taking any supplements.\\n1. Your growing baby is going to need plenty of nutrients, and it’s normal to gain weight. However, too much weight gain can put you and your baby at risk for complications, including preeclampsia. Each woman is different, so listen to your doctor. Women who are at a healthy weight when then get pregnant should expect to gain 25 to 35 pounds (11 to 16 kg), while women who are underweight should expect to gain 28 to 40 pounds (13 to 18 kg). Overweight women often gain 15 to 25 pounds (6.8 to 11.3 kg), and obese women may gain 11 to 20 pounds (5.0 to 9.1 kg). If you can, reach a healthy weight before you get pregnant. If you gain too much weight too fast, don\\'t despair! Work with your doctor to create an updated plan for healthy weight gain moving forward.\\n2. v4-460px-Prevent-Preeclampsia-Step-6.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Prevent-Preeclampsia-Step-4.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Prevent-Preeclampsia-Step-8.jpg\\n5. It’s likely you’re already limiting your caffeine consumption, but reducing your risk of preeclampsia can give you more incentive. Caffeine can spike your blood pressure, which can increase your risk of developing preeclampsia. Opt for decaffeinated drinks, instead. Avoid chocolate, since it has some caffeine in it. Don\\'t stress if you occasionally eat or drink something with caffeine in it. Try to avoid it as best you can.\\n6. Your doctor can help you identify the best dietary choices to meet your needs, as well as recommend vitamins and supplements. Your doctor can also determine how much weight you should expect to gain and may give you target weights for each doctor visit. Follow your doctor\\'s recommendations. Share your worries about preeclampsia with your doctor. Say, \"I know I have risk factors for preeclampsia. What can I do to reduce my risk?\" They can offer you suggestions targeted to your needs.\\n7. v4-460px-Prevent-Preeclampsia-Step-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10250407, 'answer_choices': [[7, 3, 5, 2, 0, 6, 1, 4], [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 2, 3], [2, 0, 5, 3, 6, 7, 4, 1], [6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 2, 1, 4]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1025046.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Clear-Red-Eyes-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n1. Green tea and chamomile tea both contain chemicals that can soothe irritated skin, reduce inflammation, and open blocked oil ducts.

Gels and ointments are thicker and last longer than drops, but they can also blur your vision for a time. That makes them best for use just before you go to sleep, so as to prevent your eyes from drying out overnight. Be sure to use a hot compress or scrub your eyelids with mild soap before applying gels or lotions. This will prevent them from clogging glands and ducts. Do not use gels or ointments if you have been diagnosed with meibomian gland disease.\\n4. For most causes of red eyes — a corneal scratch, lack of sleep, eye strain from staring at a computer screen, too much sun exposure, long road trips — rest is the best medicine. Get some extra sleep, and minimize your time looking at computers, TVs, books, and your phone. Try listening to the radio or a book on tape instead. Even if you can't take time off to give your eyes a whole day of rest, be sure to give them smaller breaks. If reading or working at a computer, you should stop every fifteen minutes and stare at a distant object for at least 30 seconds. This change in focal point will help to relax your eye muscles. Every two hours, take a 15 minute break from your screen to rest your eyes. Go for a walk, work out, have a snack, make phone calls — anything but staring at your computer screen or phone.\\n5. An eye rinse helps to remove irritants in your eye that can contribute to redness. In addition, it moisturizes and cools your eye. You can rinse your eyes with lukewarm water by letting a stream run over your eye, using an eyecup, or standing in the shower and letting the water run into your eye (do not spray it directly into your eye). For an even greater soothing effect, consider using a specially prepared eye rinse:\\nBoil a cup of distilled water. Add a tablespoon of eyebright, chamomile flowers, or crushed fennel seeds. Remove from heat, cover the pot, and let it steep for 30 minutes. Strain the liquid into a sterilized container using a coffee filter. You can keep the rinse in the refrigerator for up to 7 days.\\n6. v4-460px-Clear-Red-Eyes-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\", 'question_id': 1025046, 'answer_choices': [[6, 2, 4, 1, 3, 0, 5], [4, 2, 3, 6, 5, 0, 1], [4, 2, 1, 0, 5, 3, 6], [0, 5, 6, 3, 2, 1, 4]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10250487.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Closed loop bangles have a rigid shape and must slide over your hand when you put them on. If you’re measuring your wrist to find the right bangle size, then hold your hand in front of you with your palm face up.

Make sure the string fits snugly against your skin before you make your mark. Use a marker to draw dots on the string where it overlaps itself. Make sure to mark both ends of the string so you can take an accurate measurement. If you’re using a flexible measuring tape, look what number lines up with the 0 end. If you’re measuring wrist width, mark the string where it touches the knobby bone on the inside of your arm.\\n6. Bracelets or watches can get uncomfortable when you wear them if they’re too tight. Put an additional ⁄2 in (1.3 cm) to the measurement you found so the watch or bracelet fits looser. For example, if your wrist circumference was 5 ⁄2 inches (14 cm), then the final measurement will be 6 inches (15 cm).

Move the diluted glycerol over to the new vial carefully to avoid spills.

In order for a glycerol stock to be effective, it must be combined with a liquid bacterial culture. Producing a liquid culture will require you to incubate a bacterial sample overnight in an Erlenmeyer flask filled with lysogeny broth and the correct concentration of antibiotic. Once you’ve prepared a liquid culture, you can put the bacteria into storage or proceed to isolate the plasmid DNA. Lysogeny broth (also known as “LB broth” and “LB liquid”) is a type of nutrient-rich fluid used to propagate bacteria rapidly.

Kid's shows on television may also be a great way to stimulate your baby to emulate favorite characters. Chose stories that emphasize a certain vegetable. Then incorporate that vegetable into a meal. Be careful with television shows and kids' movies. Although some encourage kids to eat vegetables, others may commiserate with the child. Poor choices of stories may actually discourage eating vegetables. Preview whatever you choose to show your baby.\\n8. This is as simple as eating them yourself. Most of what a baby learns he learns by replicating others. If you eat the same or similar vegetables as you are feeding him then he may be more interested in eating them. This can be difficult if you have other household members who refuse to eat their vegetables. Try to have everyone pitch in to show your baby everyone is eating the same vegetables he is.\\n9. If your baby is not hungry, he will not be as interested in eating vegetables. When he is hungry, he will feel satisfaction when eating vegetables.

While many types of antidepressants can cause sexual dysfunction, some may actually increase your sex drive.

Decreasing your dosage can not only reduce your side effects, but it may also help you determine whether your low libido is actually caused by your medication. Talk to your doctor or psychiatrist about trying a lower dose of your medication to see if your libido increases. If you are taking an SSRI and experiencing sexual side effects, your doctor may recommend reducing your dose by half. Many people find that reducing their dose by half eliminates their side effects while still giving them antidepressant benefits. Before reducing your dose, your doctor may recommend waiting a few weeks to see if your side effects diminish or disappear. Sometimes it simply takes time for your body to adjust to the medication.\\n3. Before you make any changes to your medication routine, have a talk with your doctor or psychiatrist. They can inform you about your options and recommend safe ways to adjust your dosage, if needed. It can be difficult to open up to your doctor or psychiatrist about sexual side effects.

Some prescription medications can cause you to have increased prolactin levels. If you're on one of these medications, it could be the cause of your high prolactin levels. Dopamine, a brain chemical, blocks some secretion of prolactin. When you're on medications that block or lower your dopamine levels, your prolactin levels may rise. Some antipsychotics can cause this effect, such as risperidone, molindone, trifluoperazine, and haloperidol, and some antidepressants can, too. Metoclopramide, which is prescribed for severe nausea and acid reflux, may also increase the secretion of prolactin. A few medications that treat high blood pressure could also be the culprit, though it happens less frequently with these medications, which include reserpine, verapamil, and alpha-methyldopa.\\n2. This medication has been shown to reduce prolactin levels when taken in place of other antipsychotics or when taken in addition to other antipsychotics. Ask your doctor if taking this medication is a possibility for you. Antipsychotics have the potential to raise prolactin since it inhibits the dopamine that causes prolactin to secrete from the pituitary gland. For long-term antipsychotic treatment, you may develop a tolerance so your prolactin levels return to normal, but they may stay above normal levels. This medication can cause side effects like dizziness, nervousness, headaches, stomach issues, weight gain, and pain in your joints.

Any area that juts out from the glass is a weak point. Handles are the most obvious offenders, but also exposed rims, bases, or decorations are prone to breaking. Wrap a tight layer of bubble wrap around them. If you don't have bubble wrap, using packing paper or tissue paper can give these spots some extra cushioning. Newspaper is also great for packing, but the ink may leave black smudges on glass.

Carefully pull the paper's other corners over the glass. Get the wrapping as tight around the glass as you can before taping it in place. Any space between the paper and glass can mean the difference between intact glassware and shards, so wrap extra paper around the glass if you need it. Another way to do this is to position the glass at the edge of the paper, then roll it up. Make sure the inside part of the glassware remains filled. Usually packing paper provides enough protection, but you can fortify the glass with an additional layer of bubble wrap. Since bubble wrap is bulky, make sure you have enough space in your box for it! Glass vases are wrapped the same way as glassware. However, the size of many vases means you need to move them into a separate box or storage container.\\n4. Packing paper is a soft material that won't damage your glass. Try to get 3-ply paper in order to provide plenty of protection for the glass. Set the glass in the center of the paper so that you can begin wrapping it.

Either of these options works really well and will make things much easier than taking a fully assembled box. Make sure the bag or box is completely flattened so it doesn't get scrunched or wrinkled when you pack it. Bringing a flattened gift bag or box means you can just assemble the box and pack the gift when you arrive. This makes life much easier if security needs to take a look at your gift for some reason.\\n1. Plan on buying some wrapping paper when you arrive at your destination or bringing some with you in your suitcase. If you do bring wrapping paper with you, keep this wrapping paper in your carry-on luggage to avoid it getting squashed. Officials must inspect any item that triggers their sensors and if your gift is wrapped, this means it will have to be unwrapped for them. Another possible option is to simply have the gift in a gift bag so it can be easily removed if need be. Another simple advantage of waiting to decorate your gifts is that if you pack them with decorations already on, ribbons and other decorative features may be damaged in your bag.\\n2. Bubble wrap or clothes will provide padding to protect the gift during your travels. Make sure to use a piece of sticky tape to seal the bubble wrap or clothes once you've finished wrapping it. Wrapping your items in bubble wrap or clothes is a great way of minimizing the chance of your items being damaged as it provides a great cushion. You can find bubble wrap at your local convenience or home goods store.\\n3. v4-460px-Pack-Gifts-Step-2.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Pack-Gifts-Step-4.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Pack-Gifts-Step-6.jpg\", 'question_id': 10254075, 'answer_choices': [[5, 2, 0, 3, 1, 4], [4, 3, 5, 2, 1, 0], [1, 3, 2, 4, 0, 5], [0, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10254.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Write-Your-Own-Last-Will-and-Testament-Step-6-Version-6.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Write-Your-Own-Last-Will-and-Testament-Step-4-Version-6.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Write-Your-Own-Last-Will-and-Testament-Step-8-Version-6.jpg\\n3. Introduce the document as your last will and testament as the first sentence of your will. In the full declaration that follows, you need to state clearly that you are of sound mental health and of contractual capacity, and that this will expresses your last wishes. Without this important step, it could be argued that your will is not legally viable. Use this statement: “I declare that this is my last will and testament.”\\n4. v4-460px-Write-Your-Own-Last-Will-and-Testament-Step-2-Version-6.jpg\\n5. Because wills can be challenged if the testator of the will was not of sound mind (that is, the testator was suffering from dementia or another ailment that prevented him/her from understanding the effects of a will), the testator should include information in the will that proves the testator’s soundness of mind. Include this statement: “I declare that I am of legal age to make this will, and that I am sound of mind.”\\nIn addition to including the above text in the will, you may want to videotape the execution of the will to put to rest any future allegations of incapacity.\\n6. Authorize the executor to act in your interest regarding your estate, debts, funeral expenses and other items. Write clauses empowering the executor to do the following:\\nSell any real estate in which you may own an interest at the time of your death and to pledge it, lease it mortgage it or otherwise deal with your real estate as you yourself would do. Pay all of your just debts, funeral expenses, taxes and estate administration expenses. This allows your heirs to take their shares without later deductions or complications. State if your executor should post bond or serve without bond. If your executor must post a bond, the beneficiaries to the will are protected and insured if the executor fails to carry out the distribution as the will stipulates. However, requiring the executor to post a bond can be expensive for the executor, depending on the size of your estate, and could prevent your chosen executor from serving.\\n7. You have a few options here:\\nWrite your own will. Once you know your state's requirements, decide how you plan to fulfill them. You can write your own will and be responsible for making sure it fulfills your state's requirements. Be aware that state laws can change from year to year, so the process may be more complicated than you think. Hire an attorney. An attorney can review the will you write, provide you with witnesses and ensure that you have met your state's requirements. This can be a costly option depending on your attorney’s fees and how complicated your will is. Wills that “unnaturally dispose” of the testator’s assets should always be overseen by an attorney. Unnatural disposition includes cutting your family out of the will, giving all of your assets to someone that is not in your family if you have living family members and giving your assets to someone that you have not known for very long. Use an online will writing service. This type of service will automatically ensure that your will is written according to your state's requirements. Online will writing services generally cost between $60 and $100, depending on how complicated your will is.\\n8. If you're leaving part of your estate to a spouse, children or other family members, they should be named as such in your will.

Casinos typically use multiple decks to try and prevent card counters from gaining an advantage over the house. For example, if the running count is +5 and there are 6 decks remaining, the true count is 0.83. This means the player does not yet have the advantage. Always calculate the true count when there are multiple decks. This ensures that you aren't just counting the number of high cards—you're also considering the concentration of these cards compared to the low card concentration.\\n4. When the running count is positive after any given round, there are more large cards than small within the undealt cards. Increase your bet size to take advantage of these odds.\\n5.

The International Fish Oil Standards Program (IFOS) is a third-party testing and certification company for fish oil supplements.

To check if an item has been vetted by IFOS, visit the program’s Consumer Reports page and search through the listed fish oil brands. There you’ll find consumer reports for all products that have been certified. Supplements without a certification from IFOS are not guaranteed to be free of contaminants, mercury, or dioxins.\\n1. There are two main forms of omega-3 fats in fish oil, called EPA and DHA. Generally, DHA is beneficial for children and adults over age 65, while EPA is recommended for healthy adults.

Once you have finished pre-treatment and rinsing, wash your entire blanket according to instruction after you treat it. This will enable the best result for a clean blanket. If you cannot wash it straight away, keep the blanket in cold water until you can.\\n2. As soon as you spot the stain, expose the section of the blanket that has been stained. Hold this section under cold running water. You can do this whether your spot is wet or dry. Adding moisture to the stain can loosen the fibers of the blanket that might be matted down with dirt. Running water on it can cause the dirt on the surface of the stain to run off, especially if the spot is fresh. Angle the stained section away from you and downwards under the running water. This will prevent loosened dirt and water from running towards you or across the rest of the blanket. Try holding the rest of the blanket close to you and away from the faucet. It is important to use cold water because of your blanket's fabric and the stain itself. Most weighted blankets should only be washed in cool water, and hotter temperatures may cause the stain to set into the blanket's fibers.\\n3. If you drop food or anything oil based onto your blanket, use dish soap on the spot. Again, avoid anything harsh or with bleach. Unscented, non-chlorinated dish soap is the best option. Once you have run water over it, directly apply the dish soap to the area of the stain. Target the site of the spot as much as possible. Rub the soap in gently with your fingers or a very soft brush. Try a clean, soft bristled laundry or tooth brush and very gently use upward rubbing motions to lift the grease. It can be difficult to tell if a grease stain has been fully removed if it is colorless. Hold the stained section into the light in order to test if the grease stain has gone. You can also run your fingers through long fibers and feel for any greasy residue.\\n4. Your blanket might have special instructions for treating or washing it.Tags on the blanket or instructions that came with purchase may tell you if there are special washing instructions for your particular brand. If it requires special care, the manufacturer may have indicated this. Check the material of your blanket. Gentle machine washes in cold water are generally advised for most blankets, but this can differ depending on the fabric of your blanket and its level of cleanliness. Some blankets have a removable outer layer. If yours does, it can be treated and washed separately. This layer will function like a duvet cover covering the inner weighted blanket and is easily removed.\\n5. v4-460px-Wash-a-Weighted-Blanket-Step-6.jpg\\n6. v4-460px-Wash-a-Weighted-Blanket-Step-2.jpg\", 'question_id': 10256409, 'answer_choices': [[3, 4, 5, 6, 0, 1, 2], [4, 6, 2, 0, 3, 5, 1], [3, 6, 2, 4, 5, 1, 0], [3, 2, 0, 6, 5, 4, 1]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10256410.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Wash-LuLaRoe-Leggings-Step-6.jpg\\n1.

This gives you plenty of time to clear your schedule so you're available at the assigned time. While you can reschedule your interview, doing so can add months to your overall process time to become a US citizen. If you do need to reschedule, notify USCIS as soon as possible using the contact information included on your interview notification. If you don't show up for your interview, your case will be closed. Unless you contact USCIS to reschedule your interview within 1 year of the date your case was closed, your application will be denied and you'll have to start the whole process over again.\\n3. Once you've completely filled out your form, you can either file it online on the USCIS website, or you can mail the paper form to the appropriate USCIS facility. All applications must include payment of the application fee. As of 2018, the application fee includes a $640 filing fee and an $85 biometric fee, for a total of $725. You can pay with a personal check, cashier's check, money order, or major credit card. If you're mailing a paper form, go to https://www.uscis.gov/n-400 to get the address. Where you mail your form depends on the state you live in, and whether you're using the US Postal Service or another delivery method, such as FedEx or UPS.

A nest box which is close to large trees makes it easy for cats to leap from a tree to the top of the nest box. This will reduce the likelihood of any felines being able to reach the nest and predate on the birds. Nest boxes ideally should be placed at least 50 feet (15.2 m) (15 m) away from trees.\\n1. This will prevent cats and racoons from being able to climb the pole to reach the nest. A common design for predator guards is a conical metal collar which is attached convex to the nest box on the pole. A stovepipe baffle is another effective guard, which is a piece of pipe that encircles the pole and makes it very difficult to cross. There are a variety of different shapes, sizes, and designs of predator guards available from gardening and hardware stores. A stovepipe baffle will also help to prevent most snake species from reaching the nest, which makes it ideal to use if you are concerned about multiple predator species.\\n2. v4-460px-Protect-Bird-Nests-from-Predators-Step-2.jpg\\n3. The breeding season for most wild bird species is during the spring, however this can be slightly earlier or later depending on the species. Keeping your own cat indoors, and asking your neighbors to do the same, particularly at night, will help to keep the nest safe from cats. Some further signs of bird breeding season being underway are all of the typical signs that you associate with spring. Blooming flowers, light rain showers, bright plumage and feathers, and an increase in bird song are all signs that the nests will have chicks soon.\\n4. You can get nest boxes from many hardware and gardening stores. Ask the salesperson what boxes are suitable for the bird species in your backyard, as there may be one type that is more effective than another. A nest box or birdhouse that is mounted to a pole in your garden can make a huge difference for the survival of the birds in the nest.

If you\\'re making an effort to earn a profit from an activity, it typically is considered a business – even if you only do it on a part-time basis. If you have no intention of making any money off the activity, it\\'s a hobby – even if you actually make a little money from it. For example, suppose you enjoy making hair bows for girls, and decide to sell them on Etsy. The materials to make each hair bow cost you $2.00. If you sell your completed hair bows for $1.50 each, you\\'re clearly not trying to make a profit. However, if you sell them for $4.00, you\\'re earning a profit. You\\'re charging customers more than the cost of production. Don\\'t let the word \"business\" scare you. It isn\\'t necessary that you set up a corporation or even get a separate tax ID number to be considered as running a business. If you have a side gig that you intend to profit from, you have a business. Reporting your side income as income from a business allows you to deduct a loss to offset your other income. However, be careful doing this. If you consistently report a loss for several years, the IRS may determine that your activity is a hobby, not a business.\\n2. Schedule C is an addendum to your regular 1040 tax return that lists business income and expenses for the tax year. Your gross income is reduced by allowed expenses to calculate your taxable income from your side business. The total side income you earned through your business is reported on the first line of Part 1, \"Gross receipts or sales.\"\\n3. Unlike income from regular employment, taxes aren\\'t taken out of any side income you earn as an independent contractor. If you make more than $1,000 a year in self-employment income, you\\'re generally expected to pay quarterly taxes. If this is your first year operating your side gig as a business and you\\'re unsure how to estimate your tax liability, use the worksheet on IRS Form 1040-ES. You can download the form at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040es.pdf. To keep up with quarterly taxes, take 30 percent from every payment you receive and place it in a savings account.

Whether you\\'re writing fiction, creative non-fiction, or a closing trial statement, this fundamental piece of writing advice holds true. Don\\'t tell us your character is angry, show us by the tightness in her jaw, or the edge in her voice, or the way her posture stiffens ever so slightly. Don\\'t tell us that the tenement building was run down; describe the broken windows, peeling paint, and pervasive smell of urine. The key is details, details, details. Take this example of a house from Alexander McCall Smith\\'s The No. 1 Ladies\\' Detective Agency. He is describing a traditional mud hut, but he gives us so much more than that: \"It was a bare earth house in the traditional style; brown mud walls, a few glassless windows, with a knee-height wall around the yard. A previous owner, a long time ago, had painted designs on the wall, but neglect and the years had scaled them off and only their ghosts remained.\"\\n1. v4-459px-Be-a-More-Detailed-Writer-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n2. Smell, sound, taste, and touch can make your descriptions more vivid and tangible. They can take you to a place in a way that visual description often cannot. Think of the salty smell of sea air or the hiss of wind over new-fallen snow. Smell – Patrick Suskind\\'s Perfume: The Story of a Murderer has, appropriately, some particularly vivid descriptions of smell. \"People stank of sweat and unwashed clothes; from their mouths came the stench of rotting teeth, from their bellies that of onions, and from their bodies, if they were no longer very young, came the stench of rancid cheese and sour milk and tumorous disease.\" Taste – Particularly effective with food, taste language can be even more powerful elsewhere: \"A wave engulfed him. He came up and spit the briny water from his mouth.\" Sound – Listen to how Robert Frost describes the sound of a wood at night: \"Which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar / Of trees and crack of branches, common things, / But nothing so like beating on a box.\" (Robert Frost, \"An Old Man\\'s Winter Night\")\\nTouch – In \"Once More to the Lake,\" E.B. White vividly evokes the sensation of pulling on wet, cold swimming trunks: \"He pulled his dripping trunks from the line… I watched him, his hard little body, skinny and bare, saw him wince slightly as he pulled up around his vitals the small, soggy, icy garment.\"\\n3. One way to make sure you are showing and not telling is to seek out empty descriptors in your writing. These are words – usually adjectives – like \"delicious,\" which describe without really telling you anything. So the meal was delicious. How so? Did lightly fried sardines accompanied with a sweet wine smelling of apricots give way to a tartrate of egg and pungent cheese, spiced with cardamom and a dozen other spices she could not identify? Was the bread dense and rich, with a hint of earthiness, as if it had grown directly from the dark soil outside the hut? Some empty descriptors to watch out for include:\\nBeautiful\\nAmazing, incredible\\nSize adjectives (tall, short, big, large, small)\\nGood or bad\\nYoung, old\\nEmpty language also happens in non-fiction academic writing. For example, a thesis statement that says \"Shakespeare\\'s Hamlet is a good play about the contrast between good and evil\" is shallow and doesn\\'t provide any detail about your claim. In contrast, compare this detailed thesis statement: \"Shakespeare\\'s Hamlet examines the nuances of intention. Hamlet\\'s intent to avenge his father may be noble, but his willingness to annihilate everyone standing in his path to that revenge eventually outweighs any good in his purpose, making him as much a villain as King Claudius.\"\\n4. v4-459px-Be-a-More-Detailed-Writer-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n5. v4-459px-Be-a-More-Detailed-Writer-Step-4-Version-2.jpg', 'question_id': 1025930, 'answer_choices': [[5, 0, 3, 2, 1, 4], [4, 2, 0, 1, 5, 3], [2, 1, 0, 3, 4, 5], [0, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1025959.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-459px-Make-up-Your-Mind-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n1. Any time you've got to make up your mind, it's a good idea to write things down. Some studies show that writing lists help to feel an immediate sense of accomplishment, just from organizing your thoughts into list form. This is often the first step in helping to accomplish tasks and make decisions. Even if you've only got two decisions, write them down. This will allow you to start filling in details about each decision, creating a little flow chart that will help you decide. As you write, try to come up with alternative possibilities as well. If it seems like you've only got two choices, try to come up with out-of-the-box alternatives as well.\\n2. If all of the options seem unattractive to you, try to do a little innovating. Think of a non-traditional way of solving your problem to make yourself happy. Try to look beyond one or two options and find other creative and elegant solutions to the problem that you're trying to solve. If you're trying to decide what you want to make for dinner, and all you've got in the cabinet is canned tuna and Ramen noodles, think about all the other options you've got. You could go out to eat. You could run to the store really quickly. You could call a friend and see what they're having. Don't limit yourself.\\n3. After you consider the pros, consider the cons. What do you stand to lose by making this decision? What will be difficult, or challenging about completing this task? What might end up going poorly, if you choose to pursue this avenue? Try to consider all the ways you might fail. Consider a variety of cons, like time commitments, difficulty, and other aspects of the choice. Try to be realistic. If you're trying to pick a career path, it's true that being a novelist could make you a millionaire, but it's rare to crack through to that millionaire success level.\\n4. v4-459px-Make-up-Your-Mind-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\", 'question_id': 1025959, 'answer_choices': [[1, 2, 0, 4, 3], [1, 4, 3, 0, 2], [4, 3, 1, 2, 0], [0, 3, 1, 2, 4]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10261641.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Become-an-English-Teacher-in-France-Step-3-Version-2.jpg\\n1.

A mail-in program can be a great option if you regularly need to recycle lithium batteries. For example, you might work in an office that uses lithium batteries. Mail-in programs are also helpful if you don't live close to a recycling collection center. You may be able to mail-in the battery to the manufacturer. To find a mail-in program, search online for an option that meets your needs. For example, you might try https://biggreenbox.com/ or http://www.wm.com/residential/recycle-by-mail.jsp.

Read the box, and mix a small amount based on the particular ratios of bleach and activator product. Apply the bleach to a 1 in × 1 in (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) section of your body, such as your inner arm. After about 7-10 minutes, remove the product with water. If there is no redness or irritation after 24 hours, you can use the bleach kit safely. If you notice any redness or irritation after using the bleach, do not use this to bleach your body hair. If the reaction does not go away within 1-2 days, see your doctor.\\n1. v4-460px-Bleach-Body-Hair-Step-2.jpg\\n2. Set a timer for 5-10 minutes, as directed in your particular instructions. Some kits require more or less time to process the bleach. If your hair is light brown or blonde, you may not need quite as much time to process the hair.

Read over your instructions to ensure you mix the products correctly. Typically, there is a powder bleach container, a jar or cream activator, and a mixing tool in at-home bleach kits. Use the included mixing tool to scoop up the products, and put them in a small dish. Most kits call for 1 spatula of powder bleach and 2 scoops of cream activator. If you mix the bleach incorrectly, you may wind up damaging your skin. As you do this, be careful not to get the bleach on your skin.

Is it clear, detailed, and easy to understand? Does the listing tell you if the item is new or used? If these things are not clear, or you have questions, e-mail the seller and ask for clarification. What the seller tells you becomes part of the sale deal and provides a reason for return if the seller misleads you. It is better to be aware of everything than to throw away money in the hope the item will live up to your expectations.\\n7. If photos are provided, look closely at them. Are there any features that stand out? If you can enlarge the photos, do so. There is also no harm in e-mailing the seller for extra photos if desired, along with any questions you have about the images. Pay extra attention to the condition of the item in the photos. Are they only showing the picture of the box? You should be able to see the condition of the item in detail.\\n8.

You can go about selecting a church in a number of different ways, depending on your history with religion and what's available in your area, but it's important to find a church that's close and convenient so you can feel like part of the community.

If you're an Episcopalian, find out what Episcopal churches there are in your community and attend all of them to pick which one fits you best. If you weren't raised with any belief system and want to explore your options, find out the variety of different churches and religions practiced in your town and make a few visits.

This test is the least precise of the tests but is effective. The blood is drawn from the patient at any point, regardless of how much or recent the patient has eaten. If the levels come back above 200 mg/dl, then the patient may have diabetes. This can also detect Type 2 diabetes.\\n1. Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile or insulin dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition most often diagnosed in children. However, it can be diagnosed during any point in a patient's life. When a patient has Type 1, the pancreas makes little to no insulin. In most cases, this is due to the body's immune system mistakenly attacking and destroying the insulin producing cell in the pancreas. Since the body is not producing enough insulin, the glucose in your blood cannot be converted to energy. This also means that the glucose will build up in your blood stream, causing problems. Contributing factors to Type 1 diabetes are genetics and the exposure to certain viruses. A virus is a common trigger in adult onset Type 1. If you are diagnosed with Type 1, you will likely have to use insulin.\\n2. v4-460px-Diagnose-Diabetes-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Diagnose-Diabetes-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n4. This test is used to determine Type 1 diabetes and prediabetes. A blood sample is taken and sent to a lab. The lab measures the amount of blood sugar attached to the hemoglobin in the blood. This reflects the patient's blood sugar levels over the past two or three months. This test results vary by the age of the person being tested. Children can have a higher percentage than adults. If there is 5.7% or less sugar attached to the hemoglobin, the levels are normal. If the percentage is 5.7% to 6.4%, the adult patient has prediabetes. If the patient is an adolescent or younger, the level range goes up to 7.4% for prediabetes. If the percentage of sugar is higher than 6.5%, the adult patient has diabetes. For adolescent or younger patients, a percentage of sugar higher than 7.5% means the patient has diabetes.

The only real way to lower your amylase levels is to treat the underlying condition that caused them to spike. If a recent blood test showed that you have hyperamylasemia, talk to your doctor to see what additional testing is necessary to determine the cause. Pancreatitis, tumors, gallbladder infections, kidney infections, and the use of certain medications are all common causes of increased amylase levels. Additional testing may include further blood tests, a urine test, and an ultrasound or CAT scan of your abdomen.\\n1. v4-460px-Lower-Amylase-Levels-Step-4.jpg\\n2.

There are 3 different options for investing in ELSS. The growth option does not yield dividends and instead re-invests all of the fund’s profits in the short-term, yielding a larger profit at the end of the ELSS tenure. Because you won’t receive any of your investment’s dividends, your profits with this option will depend entirely on market conditions during the 3 or more years you leave your money in the ELSS. This option might be best for young people saving for retirement or for new parents saving money for their children’s education.\\n2. A fund’s expense ratio is essentially the amount of money that investors are charged by the fund management company for managing their investment. Choose a scheme with a low expense ratio to save money while investing. Expense ratios vary widely from firm to firm. Research multiple management companies before determining which expense ratio is the lowest. You can calculate expense ratio by dividing expenses incurred by the fund by its Assets Under Management (AUM).\\n3. A middle path between the growth option and the dividend option is the dividend reinvestment option. This option will allow investors to choose whether or not to keep their dividends or return them to be reinvested in the ELSS. This option may be best for market conditions that are not stable, as it allows you to keep money in a bear economy and reinvest it in a bull economy. This is also sometimes called a “growth-reinvestment option.”\\n4. v4-460px-Invest-with-an-Equity-Linked-Savings-Scheme-Step-4.jpg', 'question_id': 10265873, 'answer_choices': [[2, 0, 4, 3, 1], [2, 3, 0, 1, 4], [2, 0, 1, 4, 3], [1, 0, 2, 4, 3]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10265968.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

While all puppies need to be house trained, Rottweilers are extremely energetic and can easily create havoc in your home. In addition to being taught to go to the bathroom outside, puppies also need to learn how to play appropriately inside. Otherwise, your new pup is likely to jump on the furniture, knock things over, and even destroy things. If you can’t be home during the day to train a Rottweiler puppy, your best bet is to adopt an adult.\\n2. v4-460px-Adopt-a-Rottweiler-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n3. Many people mistakenly believe it is better to adopt a Rottweiler puppy if you already have children. The rationale is that the puppy will adjust to the kids and their playfulness better than an adult dog. Rottweiler puppies and children can be a difficult mix. The puppies have a ton of energy and are constantly nipping and biting at things. This can create problems when the puppy accidentally bites one of the kids or chews up the children’s favorite toys. The other challenge with adopting a puppy is that you have no idea how the dog will behave as an adult. It might develop a difficult disposition that clashes with your family. An adult Rottweiler’s personality and temperament are already developed, making it easier to observe how a particular Rottie will interact with and respond to your kids. With an adult dog, it is easier to select one that is a good fit for your family.', 'question_id': 1026771, 'answer_choices': [[3, 0, 1, 2], [2, 0, 1, 3], [0, 1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 0, 2]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10268417.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Choose-Exterior-Paint-Colors-for-Your-House-Step-4.jpg\\n1. The color of paint you choose will look slightly different depending on your location. Think about how much light reaches the exterior of your home and consider any artificial lamps or light posts nearby. This can be helpful when selecting particular shades of paint. If you live in a house near a lot of trees, the color may look darker once painted on your house. You may want to choose a lighter shade to offset and shadows. If you live in a well-lit development, artificial light may make the color look brighter, for example. It may be helpful to select a darker shade to balance the overall look.\\n2. v4-460px-Choose-Exterior-Paint-Colors-for-Your-House-Step-6.jpg\\n3. In addition to your siding color, you can also choose a couple colors to use to accent the outside of your house. Use 1 color for your shutters, door, and trim for a uniform look, or pick a different color for both your shutters and the door to liven up your space. This adds subtle pops of color, which makes your house look streamlined and unique. For example, if you want a classic, timeless look, paint your house light cream and go with a navy blue shutter and door color. If you want a personalized look, consider painting the house light yellow, selecting forest green shutters, and coloring the door a bright burgundy hue.\\n4. Before you start to look at paint chips, envision how you want your house to look. Do you want to freshen up a dingy paint job? Add a bright color to liven up your space? Or restore a house’s historical significance? Considering how you want to upgrade your house can help choose your paint colors. For instance, if you are revitalizing an old colonial home, go with a classic color palette, like beige, brick-red, and cream. If you want to modernize your home, consider going with a bold color like red or navy. For a modern style, consider slate-gray, white, or charcoal shades. If you want a quaint, inviting style, go with warm colors and earth tones, such as rust, terracotta, or forest green.\\n5. v4-460px-Choose-Exterior-Paint-Colors-for-Your-House-Step-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10268417, 'answer_choices': [[1, 4, 2, 0, 5, 3], [4, 5, 3, 0, 1, 2], [2, 4, 0, 1, 5, 3], [1, 0, 3, 2, 4, 5]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10268961.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Read-Greens-Step-6.jpg\\n1. Reading a green is about anticipating how your golf ball will move from your putter to the hole. No green is perfectly flat, so you always need to take a close look at the slope to do this. Any hills or divots will also change the speed of your ball and, sometimes, its trajectory. You can’t always putt along the flattest part of the green. Most times, you need to hit the ball along the green’s slope in order to curve the ball towards the hole. The route your ball takes from the putter to the green is called a line. Always take time to read the green’s slope before determining your line.\\n2. v4-460px-Read-Greens-Step-2.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Read-Greens-Step-4.jpg\\n4. Once you have identified which part of the green is lowest, you know which way your ball will roll after you hit it. Stroll back to your ball, taking plenty of time to examine how the green changes. Any subtle changes, such as slope increases, have an effect on how your ball moves. If you are uncertain of a particular spot you need to hit through, crouch! Get a close look at the grass. Note any uneven spots that can drag your ball away from the hole.\\n5. Return to your ball, taking care to avoid any penalties from disturbing it. Look down and notice if the ball is higher or lower than your feet. This should give you a little extra information about how the ball will behave. Fine-tune your approach to compensate for the slope near your ball. For example, if your right foot is higher than the bottom of the ball, the ball will roll towards your left foot.

Here are some thoughtful favors you can do to show you care:\\nIf your loved one has a cold, take on pet duty for the week. Offer to walk his/her dog in the mornings, or to help feed and take care of his/her pet. If your loved one\\'s allergies are raging, offer to water the plants for a few weeks until he/she feels better. If your loved one is tied up at work, step out to get them some lunch and hot coffee.

I can\\'t wait to see you tonight!\" This will make your loved one smile as soon as he/she sees it. Here are some other ways to leave thoughtful notes:\\nLeave a note in your loved one\\'s textbook or pleasure-reading book. Your loved one may not find it for a few days, but when he/she does, it\\'ll put a big smile on his/her face. If your loved one is going away on a trip for a few days, put it in his or her travel bag, in a place where he/she won\\'t look until he/she gets to his/her destination. This will make them think of you as soon as he/she opens it, and you won\\'t feel like you\\'re so far away.

You can also use special formatting—such as italic text—as a visual cue to your reader that they are reading a flashback. You might use this formatting by itself or in addition to textual indicators. For example: “At the sound of Wilfred’s voice, Bob froze. It was all coming back to him. Wilfred was standing beside him on the corner of 59th and Strauss. An icy, driving rain was falling, and neither of them had an umbrella.”\\nFor longer works, such as novels, you can also separate flashbacks into their own chapters, alternating with chapters set in the present timeline.\\n1. Flashbacks are often distinguished from the action of the main timeframe by being written in a different tense. Whatever tense you choose, make sure you apply it consistently throughout the flashback, or the reader will be confused. Don’t feel confined to writing your flashback in the past tense. If your main timeframe is written in the simple past, you might make the flashback feel more immediate and engaging by putting it in the present tense. For example: “Harold lifted the perfume bottle to his nose, feeling the brittle paper of the label beneath his fingers. That smell . . . It’s 1922. His mother sits at her vanity, brushing her hair. The room smells faintly of oranges and vanilla.”\\n2. v4-460px-Write-a-Flashback-Step-6.jpg\\n3. Your flashback will feel most real and immersive if you know exactly when it takes place. You don’t necessarily have to tell your reader when it is happening down to the date and time, but it will help you as a writer if you know these details. For example, instead of setting a flashback at some vague point during your character’s childhood, you might set it in August, a few days before their 6th birthday. It can also help to think about how specific details might differ between your flashback and the present day. Do your characters look, act, or speak differently? How has the setting changed? Is the cultural context different?\\n4. Flashbacks can be useful, but they aren’t always necessary to tell a clear and engaging story. Before writing a flashback, think about what exactly you are trying to accomplish and how it will serve your story. For example, you might use a flashback to:\\nProvide information about a character’s past that sheds light on their current actions, beliefs, or attitudes (such as revealing a past trauma or other formative experience in the character’s life). Give context or information about events that are happening during the present plot (such as an important clue to a mystery plot). Helping the world of the story feel deeper and richer (e.g., providing historical background for the setting of a fantasy story).\\n5. v4-460px-Write-a-Flashback-Step-8.jpg\\n6. v4-460px-Write-a-Flashback-Step-2.jpg\\n7. v4-460px-Write-a-Flashback-Step-4.jpg\\n8. A lot of flashbacks can bog down the action and leave your reader feeling confused or frustrated. If you’re writing a short story and feel you must include flashbacks, try to select one or two key past moments to focus on.

A bishop position will not open until the current bishop reaches 75, becomes very ill, or dies.

This is another very common cause of machine imbalance. Look for a visual guide on the side or top of the machine showing how full your machine should be. Most washing machines aren’t designed to be packed anywhere near to the top before starting the cycle so ensure that there is still plenty of room in the drum. Overfilling is a common occurrence with people trying to get a lot of washing done at once so if you’re close to being full, just split it up into two loads.\\n2. Normally, you can stop a washing machine by simply lifting the lid if it is a top load, or opening the door if it is a front load. If this isn’t the case or the door won’t open, look for a “pause” button on the control panel on the top of the machine. Make sure to stop the machine in the middle of a cycle as this method relies on there being an issue with the way that the clothes are arranged inside the machine.

All of these foods also make it harder for the liver to do its work, so minimizing them will improve your liver function. For instance, try to avoid choosing sweet or salty snacks whenever possible. Picking a vegetable, whole-grain cracker, or low-fat dairy products will help your liver function much better than a salty potato chip or a candy bar. Focus on eating healthier fats, including vegetable oils and those that are in nuts and fish. These are monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Instead of eating processed sugars, eat fruit. Fruits contain natural sugars that can satiate your sugar cravings in a healthier way.', 'question_id': 10279307, 'answer_choices': [[4, 1, 0, 2, 3], [0, 3, 4, 1, 2], [3, 1, 4, 2, 0], [3, 4, 2, 0, 1]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1027935.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Get-Rid-of-Wasps-in-Your-House-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n1.

Choose accessories that are not going to pull too much attention away from your dress — especially if your dress is patterned. Shorter necklaces pair well with the typical wrap dress plunge neckline, and simple rings or bracelets can complement necklaces nicely.

It's easier to become jealous of people around you if you aren't happy with yourself. Feelings of inadequacy increase the likelihood that you will experience jealousy. You can find happiness in yourself by doing following:\\nFocusing on internal strengths. When you focus on external factors, such as popularity or earning potential, those things could shift and your self-esteem could crumble. When you focus on internal factors, your self-esteem is built on a much more stable foundation and you will be happier with yourself. Practicing daily intentions. Remind yourself that you are capable of giving and receiving love, attention, and respect, and that you are deserving of these things. Post them somewhere visible, such as on your mirror or computer monitor. Consider saying them out loud each day. Visual prompts can be very helpful for affirmations.\\n2. Often, when you figure out what your insecurities or challenges are, you will be able to build them into strengths, which will prohibit feelings of jealousy. While it isn’t an easy task to examine yourself for your flaws, it must be done. Remind yourself that you are more than just your insecurities. Try to keep a positive mindset while identifying areas in which you are insecure. Remind yourself of things you do feel confident in or like about yourself. Remember that you can change any insecurity into a strength with time and effort. For example, perhaps you are lonely and want to make more friends, but you are not outgoing. Practice being outgoing and friendly toward strangers and eventually you will have turned your shyness into friendliness and you’ll have made new friends.\\n3. v4-460px-Accept-Being-Disliked-Step-7.jpg\", 'question_id': 102795, 'answer_choices': [[3, 1, 0, 2], [2, 3, 1, 0], [2, 3, 0, 1], [0, 1, 2, 3]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10279634.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Administration officers want to hear about you as a person as well as see how well you write. The essay portion of the application is your chance to shine. Tell the admissions officers a story about yourself or an interesting fact you didn’t mention earlier on your application. Several basic questions are provided on the application, but you only have to answer 1. The essay can be as long and as detailed as you want it to be. To write your essay, brainstorm some potential topics. Try to make a basic outline, then write a few cohesive paragraphs. Edit your essay before submitting it. Some potential topics to write about are meaningful interests you have, a lesson you have learned from a setback, or a topic you find engaging. These topics will seem broad at first.

Items like art portfolios, music tracks, and academic articles all bolster your application. Use these items to show your work, your personality, and your interests. If you plan on studying art, music, or similar subjects, you should always submit a relevant supplement. Other applicants can still score points with the admissions office by including these items. No matter what you want to study, you won't be forced to submit a supplement. All undergraduates use the same standardized application for general admissions. In addition, this gives you the opportunity to change your mind about what you want to study. Upload printed articles in the applicant status portal at https://apply.college.harvard.edu/account/. For media such as artwork and music, submit it to the Slide Room page located at https://harvard.slideroom.com/#/Login.\\n4. v4-460px-Apply-to-Harvard-University-Step-6.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Apply-to-Harvard-University-Step-2.jpg\\n6. v4-460px-Apply-to-Harvard-University-Step-8.jpg\\n7. You will see the teacher evaluation form at the end of your application. Print out 2 copies, then give them to your favorite teachers. Try to choose teachers that cover different academic subjects. Have them mail the forms to Harvard’s admissions office. The best time to ask a teacher is at least 4 weeks before the application deadline. Reach out to them at a less hectic time of the day, such during lunch or after school. If you can, ask them the same year you attend their class. Give your teachers stamped, addressed envelopes to make the mailing process easier for them.\\n8. These activities are the main focus of a lot of application reviewers. Competitive schools like Harvard want well-rounded students who lead a rich, vibrant life outside of school. You don’t have to list a lot of different awards or activities, but make sure what you add shows who you are as a person. These activities and experiences are very different from supplements like art portfolios. Every applicant needs to include significant extracurriculars in order to have a shot at getting into Harvard. Remember that activities are about quality, not quantity. The school is interested in how you improve your family, school, and community. Think about what activities you care about and put a lot of effort into. For instance, if you participated in a prestigious research institution, you would want to list it on your application. Similarly, mention how you were part of the Science Olympiad and earned national recognition. You may not have had a lot of opportunities for activities. This won’t hurt your application. Instead, think of things like babysitting, taking care of your home, or working in a family business that you can list.\\n9. Harvard accepts applications through 3 main services. These are all standardized applications that can be submitted to multiple schools. They are all judged equally during the application process, so you don’t need to worry about which one you decide to complete. The Common Application is used by over 750 schools. Start an application by creating an account at https://www.commonapp.org. The Universal College Application is similar to the Common Application but is currently accepted by a handful of schools. Access it at https://www.universalcollegeapp.com. The Coalition Application is designed to help low-income and first-generation students apply.

Plan your trip early in the season to see icebergs and penguins building their nests. Your ability to go to shore may be limited early in the season. Go during the middle of the season to watch sea lion pups, penguins, and other birds. Go at the end of the season for a chance to see the whales.\\n1. v4-460px-Visit-Antarctica-on-a-Budget-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n2. Since you will be traveling outside of the country, you will need to have a valid passport. Visit a passport agency to fill out the required documents and have your picture taken. Plan on a wait time of up to 6 weeks to receive your passport. When applying for a passport, you will need to bring proof of your identity and citizenship.

Two females are ideal to start with because they get along and can be kept together better than male mice, who are more aggressive. Lonely mice become depressed easily and will die from loneliness by not eating and wasting away. Start out with 2 mice that are the same size. Female mice are ideal because they’re less aggressive than males. It’s best not to risk letting 2 male mice live in a cage together unless one of them is neutered. Male mice usually fight, and it can end in injury or death.\\n1. v4-460px-Keep-Multiple-Pet-Mice-Step-2.jpg\\n2. One alternative method is to dab a bit of vanilla on their rear ends to make all the mice smell the same to each other. They’re more likely to accept each other easier in the initial introduction.

That is, you may want to make personal promises to each other, but you may also want to include some more classic lines. Take some time to look at opposite-sex vows, particularly ones related to your faith if you\\'re religious. Decide what you\\'d like to use from those traditions. It\\'s fine to mix and match, as long as you agree (and the officiant is okay with it). You should also consider including something about children, if you or your partner already has children. You also might want to include a promise about parenting and committing to parent your partner\\'s child or children.\\n1. The heart of the vow is what you promise to each other. You are making a pact to be together, and your vows should reflect that pact. In other words, before writing, think about what you bring to the relationship, and how you will uphold the other person. As a same-sex couple, it\\'s still a perilous privilege to legally marry your spouse, and your vows could reflect that, too, such as \"I promise to defend you when other people try to bring us down.\"\\n2. v4-460px-Write-Same-Sex-Marriage-Vows-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-1028048-2.jpg\\n4. Part of the promises you make usually include a section about how you accept the other person, and how you plan to love them. You can define these promises by length of time (life) or the specific times you will love them through (i.e. sickness and health). For example, you could say something like, \"I accept you just as you are, with all your best and worst qualities, and I promise that I will love you through all the good times and the bad times.\" Alternatively, you could say something like, \"I cherish who you are as a person, and I promise to love that person all our lives.\"\\n5. v4-460px-Write-Same-Sex-Marriage-Vows-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n6. Spend some time expanding on what the person means to you. Make some heartfelt statements about the person\\'s value. Don\\'t forget to tell the person how much you love and cherish them. Think about why you wanted to marry the person in the first place. What makes you smile every time she does it? Does your heart burst when he walks into the room? What are your favorite little quirks?\\n7. v4-460px-Write-Same-Sex-Marriage-Vows-Step-8.jpg\\n8. Some couples write their vows together, with the intention of keeping them similar. Other couples write vows separately, with each person deciding what they want to say to the other person. Sometimes, the second kind of vows are kept secret until the wedding, though sometimes, you may also want to write different vows together. That way, they are unique, but you can still have vows that go together.

Measure and mark 4 feet (1.2 m) outward from the center of the line you drew from the longest wall. Then, make a second mark 3 feet (0.91 m) down along the center of the wall line. Stretch your tape measure between the 3 ft (0.91 m) mark and the 4 ft (1.2 m) mark. The distance between the 2 marks should be exactly 5 ft (1.5 m). Make a final mark where the tape measure crosses the 4 ft (1.2 m) mark to pinpoint the room's center. This method is useful for establishing a starting point in rooms with odd dimensions.\\n1. Run a tape measure along the wall from corner to corner. Record this number in your notebook, being sure to specify which measurements are which. If the room you’re working in is perfectly square, you can start with either set of opposing walls. Be sure to measure the wall using the same unit as your tiles. If the length and width of the tiles is given in inches, for example, you’ll want to measure the room in inches, as well.\\n2. v4-460px-Plan-Tile-Layout-Step-4.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Plan-Tile-Layout-Step-6.jpg\\n4. To ensure that the line is straight, run the tip of your pencil along the edge of a yardstick or straight edge, using a framing square to ensure a precise 90-degree angle. Slide your yardstick down and double-check its orientation every few feet to keep the line from becoming crooked. You can also use a chalk line tool for greater efficiency and exactness. Simply extend the retractable wire between the 2 walls, then pull up and release the wire quickly to leave behind a perfectly straight line of chalk.\\n5. To determine the square footage of a square or rectangular room, simply find the length of 2 adjacent walls in square feet and multiply them together. For irregularly-shaped areas like closets, alcoves, and counters, multiply the length and width of the extra space separately, then add this number to the square footage of the main part of the room. If you're measuring a rectangular room that's 18 square feet (1.7 m) x 12 square feet (1.1 m), for example, the total square footage would be 216 square feet (20.1 m). Figuring out the room's square footage will tell you exactly how much tile you'll need for your flooring project, which may influence the size and style you go with.\\n6. v4-460px-Plan-Tile-Layout-Step-2.jpg\", 'question_id': 10280531, 'answer_choices': [[5, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 0], [5, 0, 1, 6, 2, 3, 4], [2, 4, 5, 1, 0, 3, 6], [5, 4, 0, 6, 3, 1, 2]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1028072.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Deal-With-Aggressive-Customers-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n1. Even when everyone’s calm, violating someone’s personal space can be interpreted as a show of aggression or lack of care for someone’s level of comfort. When people get angry, they need a larger area of personal space, so give aggressive customers wide berth. Otherwise, they may think you’re trying to show aggression of your own, or that you’re not taking the situation seriously by failing to recognize how agitated they’ve grown. For your own personal safety, try to stand behind a counter, table, or another barrier to reinforce the physical distance between you and the customer.\\n2. v4-460px-Deal-With-Aggressive-Customers-Step-6.jpg\\n3. In order to calm a customer down, you need to understand why they’re upset in the first place. If the customer is so worked up that they’re ranting instead of providing you with useful information that you could use to assess and resolve the situation, wait until there’s a gap in the conversation to ask guided questions that will help you understand what’s going on. Again, don’t cut the customer off — wait for an opportunity for you to speak. Some questions you might ask include: \\n\"Is this the first time you\\'ve had this issue at our business? Can you tell me more about your previous frustrations, so I know specifically how to instruct our staff to improve customer experience?\" \"Tell me exactly what happened today, from the beginning. What was the exact employee behavior that triggered your bad experience?\" \"Was there a single action that ruined your experience with us, or are you frustrated by the buildup of several small problems? Is there one large thing we need to change, or several small adjustments?\" \"Which employee or employees are you upset with right now? Is there one person in particular, or does our whole staff need to be addressed about their attitudes and performance?\" If another employee is involved, use your discretion to determine whether or not it would calm the customer down to involve that employee in the conversation.\\n4. v4-460px-Deal-With-Aggressive-Customers-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n5. The worst thing you can do in this situation is to raise your energy level to theirs, as it might turn a combustible situation into an all-out explosion. However, because you, as an employee, cannot simply walk away from the situation, you must stay engaged with the customer without letting your own temper get out of hand. The most obvious thing to avoid is raising your voice. Don’t be sarcastic with the customer. You will convey the message that you do not care, and that will aggravate them.

Many races require that your dogs are up-to-date on their shots and vaccines. When getting their shots, your vet should also examine the dogs for other illnesses or problems. Sled dogs are more likely to have joint problems then regular dogs, so if you catch the problem early, it could save your dog a lot of pain later and keep your team strong.

Sled dogs are bred for cold temperatures. However, even the hardiest sled dogs have their limits. The temperature a dog can comfortably handle varies depending on its age, coat, and overall health, and there is no absolute temperature at which dogs should be kept from the elements. However, stay attentive to your dogs’ behavior and attitude, and look for changes that might occur in extreme weather. If your dogs are shivering, curled up in the snow and not moving, or engaging in other behavior that indicates they are unable to tolerate the temperature, don’t force them to continue running. Dogs can get frostbite, so always use caution if you suspect your dogs are at risk. In extreme weather, dress your dogs in special coats and blankets to give them an added layer of protection against the cold. Wash your dogs at least once a month. Use a mild soap or shampoo specially designed for dogs that won’t dry out their skin. Special dog shampoos are available at pet stores.\\n4. Your dogs should eat a mix of high-quality dry and wet (canned) food with high levels of fat and protein. The protein and fat content in the food provides your dogs with the energy they need to run long distances. Whatever you feed your dogs, they should be taking in around 10,000 calories each day when they’re on the trail. Some mushers mix a cup or two of water into the food to help the dogs digest the food more easily and prevent dehydration. Adding water is also necessary when thawing out frozen food on the trail. Many sled dogs also like fish. Be sure to cook it thoroughly and remove bones before feeding it to your dogs.

There are quite a few options when it comes to traveling to Williamsburg, and they’re listed below. Travel by car. Williamsburg is located 150 miles (240 km) south of Washington D.C, halfway between Richmond and Virginia Beach. Travel by plane. Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport (PHF) is located 17 miles (27.4 km) from downtown Williamsburg, while Norfolk International Airport (ORF) and Richmond International Airport (RIC) are both located 45 miles (72.4 km) from downtown Williamsburg. All three of these airports also have shuttle options for getting to Williamsburg. Travel by train or bus. The City of Williamsburg Transportation Center in downtown Williamsburg has Amtrak, as well as bus services. You can also rent a car here to use during your trip, or grab a taxi, Uber, or Lyft if you need one.\\n1. 460px-Hilton_Garden_Inn%2C_Williamsburg%2C_VA.jpg\\n2. Although Williamsburg is fairly popular year-round, you’ll find that the best time to visit is in the fall and spring. This is due to the fact that there are usually fewer crowds to deal with, and it won’t be too hot (which can happen in the summer, when temperatures can reach close to 90°F), nor too cold (which can happen in the winter, when temperatures can go as low as 30°F). However, because of Williamsburg’s pretty much year-round tourism, you can visit at a time that works best for you. If you do visit at Christmas time, you’ll be able to enjoy quite a few winter celebrations and activities for both kids and adults. Williamsburg is definitely the most popular in the summer, due to most schools being out on summer break.\\n3. You can of course choose to rent/bring your own car, but if you choose not to, you’ll still be able to use Williamsburg’s two public transportation bus companies: Oleta Coach Lines and Williamsburg Area Transportation, or WATA.

Once you’ve decided where you’ll be celebrating, look up the parade route and start to think about where you want to watch. Many people like to watch Pride parades from outside major LGBT landmarks (like the Stonewall Inn in New York City), but these areas can get crowded fast. If smaller crowds and more breathing room is more your speed, look for wider streets on less central areas of the route. You can also try to watch the parade from a building along the route. You won’t be as close, but you’ll have a better view and less crowded atmosphere.\\n1. While the parade is typically the main event of a city’s Pride celebrations, the festivities don’t end there. If you’re looking to celebrate before and after the parade, you can check out bars and nightclubs having Pride parties, or opt for sober or family-friendly events. Look online to see what events your city is offering and plan out the rest of your day. Try to head for events that give back to the LGBT community. Their advertisements should say something like, “Proceeds go to…”, followed by a non-profit LGBT group.\\n2. v4-460px-Go-to-an-LGBT-Pride-Parade-Step-2.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Go-to-an-LGBT-Pride-Parade-Step-3.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Go-to-an-LGBT-Pride-Parade-Step-5.jpg\\n5.

Every parade is different, but you can expect marching bands, clowns, drag queens, and dancers alongside LGBT-friendly politicians, church choirs, and local businesses. Every float is unique, but each participant will be spirited and excited to be there. You can also expect to see some contingents that march in nearly every LGBT Pride parade, such as Parents, Friends, and Families of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) and People with AIDS.\\n6.

Spell out what you hope to achieve if you end up getting the position you’re applying for. The shift in focus from your history to your future suggests a forward-thinking attitude and an eagerness to leave your mark. For this reason, it’s a very effective strategy for ending your resume profile. Tailor the language of your final sentence to make it clear what you have to offer your employer. For example, rather than saying, “I hope to eventually lead a team of researchers,” try, “My desire is that my ongoing research will help lead Vitalab to major breakthroughs in the field biomedical engineering.”\\n1. Before you start drafting your resume profile, read through the listing for the position you’re applying for. The language you find there will give you a better idea of the kind of terms you should include in your profile. A description that reads, \"We are currently seeking enthusiastic, motivated self-starters to work in a fast-paced corporate environment\" is essentially advertising an ideal employee. Avoid using your buzzwords in the same order in which they\\'re found in the listing. Otherwise, it may be obvious that you\\'re trying to make yourself look like you fit the bill.\\n2. Your opening sentence should explain who you are, what you do, and how your specific strengths translate to the demands of the position you’re seeking. This is your chance to tell the employer why you’d make a good candidate, even before you begin describing your specific accomplishments. The first line of your profile might say something like, “Multi-talented marketing executive and graphic designer with 25 years of combined industry experience.”\\nIf you’re currently unemployed or looking to change careers, reference previous duties or more general qualities that you think would be desirable to your potential employer.

Construction paper works well for this, as it is a little sturdier than normal paper. Choose your colors, for example red, black, blue, green, yellow, and orange.

Vitamin supplements, as you may have guessed, are meant provide any vitamins and minerals that are lacking in your diet. Track what you eat to see if there are specific vitamins and minerals lacking in your diet, and look for supplements that include those nutrients. If you are vegetarian or vegan, for instance, some key nutrients like vitamin B12 are mostly found in animal products. In this case, you will want to take vegan B12 supplements. It may be helpful to track what you eat for a week, then bring this information to a dietitian to assess what vitamins you might need to supplement.\\n3. v4-460px-Choose-Vitamin-Supplements-Step-4-Version-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10283, 'answer_choices': [[1, 0, 2, 3], [2, 0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 3, 0], [2, 0, 1, 3]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1028413.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Make-Earrings-Step-22-Version-3.jpg\\n1.

Before searching for apprenticeships, you should work on growing your knowledge of watchmaking. An expansive knowledge of watchmaking will make you more employable. Take apart a watch that you won't mind getting damaged. Then, try to put it together again. This will help you understand the anatomy of a watch. Take notes or draw diagrams that you can refer to once the watch is reassembled.\\n3. When you're making a watch you also need to consider the style of strap attached. Most watches use metal straps or leather straps. A metal strap uses buckled segments to form a strap around the wrist. This is a tough strap, but some find it uncomfortable. Some prefer a leather strap with a buckle to adjust tightness, but leather is less durable.\\n4. Smart watches are growing in popularity. Although there is still a sizeable market for a traditional watch, consider looking into the basic engineering behind a smart watch. Consider how to fit a larger battery into the chassis of the watch. Research wireless charging to understand how smart watches function. Hybrid watches use elements of smart watches, such as connectivity with smart phones, but they still retain the outer look of a classic watch. Continue learning the parts of a watch by looking at diagrams online.\\n5. v4-460px-Become-a-Watchmaker-Step-6.jpg\\n6. All watches have a thin crystal layer covering the watch face. The most common types of watch casings are synthetic sapphire crystal, mineral crystal, and acrylic crystal. Sapphire is a very hard material, bested only by diamond. Watchmakers use lab synthesized sapphire to utilise its natural hardiness. This crystal is expensive, but very tough. Mineral crystal is a form of glass. Mineral crystal is relatively inexpensive. However, the material scratches easily, and it cannot be buffed out. Mineral crystal needs to be replaced in order to appear new again. Acrylic crystal is the cheapest form of crystal covering. It is made out of plastic and can scratch easily. Acrylic crystal scratches can be buffed out.

If you're a beginning investor or don't have much experience trading in futures, this practice can help you understand how the futures market works and whether futures will be good investments for your portfolio. When comparing virtual trading accounts, find out how many tools and services will be available to you. Some sites make everything available on a virtual account that you would have for a real trading accounts. Others may limit resources for research and analysis on virtual accounts.

Don\\'t chase after temporary things that lead you away from God, e.g., filling all your time with TV and the Internet instead of spending an adequate amount of time praying or reading Scripture. Chasing pleasures gives temporary satisfaction. These are temporary because you don\\'t feel as fulfilled by what you have and end up feeling dissatisfied and frustrated.

Joyful indeed are those whose God is the Lord\" (Psalm 144:15). His gifts set you free and let you explore truth and love to their fullest. Such an experience means living a fuller life in the light and path of God. Know the nature of your current focus and identify the temptations that lead your mind and heart away from God. Once you identify those distractions, you can avoid them to begin living with God and following His chosen path for you.

The scalp produces a natural oil called sebum that protects the hair from drying out. When you wash your hair too often, you wash away this oil before it has the chance to travel down the length of your hair and provide protection. Washing your hair just a few times a week will help your hair stay shiny and healthy. When you first stop washing your hair every day, your scalp will overproduce sebum, since it's used to your routine of washing it away every 24 hours. After a week or so things will balance out and your hair will no longer look greasy right away. If you have oily hair or skin, this process can take up to three or four months. If you're concerned about your roots looking greasy on the days in between washings, use dry shampoo to clean things up. You can buy a bottle of dry shampoo or making your own by simply mixing 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and 1/2 tablespoon of baking soda. Sprinkle it onto the greasy areas, let it sit for five minutes, then comb it out.\\n2. Many popular hair treatments strip the hair of its natural oils and damage the hair shaft. When you're ready to restore your hair, it'll be very difficult to do so unless you stop all treatments and let your hair return to its natural state. If you're used to relying on treatments to make your hair look the way you want it to, you may want to choose a few treatments that are the most important to you and stop using all of the rest. Here's what to avoid:\\nChemical hair dyes, either professional or from a box. If you love dyeing your hair, try a natural dye such as tea, which might actually help to restore your hair instead of damaging it. Bleaching your hair is never good for it. Stripping out the color in your hair does a lot of damage to the shaft, and can cause your hair to get brittle and break. Chemical straightening or curling, like a Brazilian blowout, relaxers, or a permanent. The chemicals that force straight hair to be curly or curly hair to be straight and sleek do a lot of damage to your hair.\\n3. If you brush your hair while it's wet, you can easily damage it. Work out tangles with a wide-tooth comb. Gently work it through your hair, starting near the tips and gradually working up toward the roots until you're able to move the comb through your hair without catching on a tangle. Once your hair is fully dry, you can use a boar-bristle brush to smooth it out. Brushing with a plastic-bristled brush is very damaging to hair, especially when you try to brush through tangles. You end up pulling out hairs and breaking them off mid-shaft. If you have curly hair, avoid brushing it at all. Stick to using a wide-tooth comb.\\n4. v4-460px-Restore-Damaged-Hair-Step-4.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Restore-Damaged-Hair-Step-6.jpg\", 'question_id': 1028994, 'answer_choices': [[5, 3, 0, 1, 4, 2], [1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 0], [3, 4, 1, 5, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1, 4, 3, 5]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1029004.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

Guava works in a wide variety of soils so long as the soil has good internal and external drainage. This just means soil that allows water to pass through it easily. To check for this kind of soil, dig a 1 foot (0.30 m) hole and pour a little water into it. If the water disappears in only a few minutes, it’s good soil. If it continues to sit, then you’ll need to find another location. You should avoid shallow soil and compact, layered soil. This will make it difficult for your roots to stretch. If your soil is hard and compact, you can add compost to help it reach the correct conditions. Dig down 2 feet (0.61 m) deep and work the composite into the soil.\\n1. Guava trees thrive in areas where the summers are warm, and the winters are cool. Normal outside temperatures should be between 59 °F (15 °C) and 82 °F (28 °C).

As a manager, you should always strive to improve or develop your bar. Think of new ways to promote your bar. Come up with signature or themed drinks. Think about offering daily specials.\\n3. Part of being an effective bar manager is having a full understanding of the business. Knowing what it takes for a bar to be successful will help you best direct your staff, menu, bar function, and focus your efforts overall. Even though you are technically a manager you should be ready to understand how every thing in the bar business comes together. Understand each role that your staff plays. Be ready to work late or long hours. Learning more about the theme or direction of the bar can help. Have an active hand in creating and maintaining any menus. Learn what your customers want and try to meet those needs. Knowing business functions such as ordering, inventory, cash register operation, bookkeeping and marketing will be essential to your success as a manager.\\n4.

You will need to strictly stay within any budget you have been given, try to lower operating costs when possible, and maybe even create a budget yourself.

Venus gets its yellowish-brown color from the clouds of sulfur dioxide that cover its surface. However, if you were able to travel through the clouds and look at the actual surface of the planet, it would look brownish-red.\\n5. Mars is the second smallest planet in the solar system, so draw it slightly bigger than Mercury but smaller than Venus and Earth. Then, color it in with red and brown to give it a rusty color. Mars gets its iconic rusty red coloring from the iron oxide that covers its surface. Iron oxide also gives blood and rust their color.\\n6. v4-460px-Draw-the-Solar-System-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n7. v4-460px-Draw-the-Solar-System-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n8. The sun is the largest body in the solar system, so draw a large circle to represent it. Then, color it in with orange, yellow, and red to represent the hot gases that it’s made up of. Remember to leave enough space on the page to draw all of the planets. The Sun is made up of mostly helium and hydrogen gas, and it's constantly converting hydrogen into helium through a process called nuclear fusion.

If the existing owners are open to adding you into the business as a partner, find out how much that business is worth. An independent valuation will also help the existing owners, as they will have to realign the percentages of the business they own after you come on board. Before you sink money into a business, you want to know exactly how much that business is worth. You also need an objective assessment of that business's potential.

Some of the more sensitive signs may see the logoff penchant for telling it like it is to be rude and lacking tact. That's not what the Sagittarius is intending to do! They simply don't see the value in not being open and truthful. They're not being malicious. It's simply a symptom of their individualized character that they need to express.

You'll have all these emotions swirling around that you're dying to express and you're getting a blank stare in return. Don't take it too personally.

Did the franchisee have the necessary experience and skills? Were training programs adequate? How would they describe the relationship with the franchisor?

Writing in the arena of arts and entertainment (like movie reviews, book reports, etc.) carries fewer rules and expectations than technical writing, but the beginnings of essays written in this style still benefit from an overarching strategy. In these cases, while you can get away with a little playfulness in the beginning of your essay, you\\'ll usually need to take care to ensure that you describe your the overall theme or focus even as you pinpoint small, specific details. For example, if you\\'re writing a review and analysis of P.T. Anderson\\'s film The Master, you might start like this: \"There\\'s a moment in The Master that\\'s small, but hard to forget. Speaking to his teenage paramour for the very last time, Joaquin Phoenix\\'s naval washout suddenly tears through the window screen that\\'s separating them and embraces the girl in a passionate kiss. It\\'s at once beautiful and perverse, and perfectly emblematic of the twisted depiction of love the film presents.\" This opening uses a small, compelling moment from the film to capture the main theme in a compelling way.\\n1. v4-460px-Begin-an-Essay-Step-11.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Begin-an-Essay-Step-9.jpg\\n3. Journalistic essay writing differs somewhat from other essay styles. In journalism, there is usually a great effort made to focus on the pure facts of the story, rather than the writer\\'s opinion, so the introductory passages of a journalistic essay tends to be somewhat descriptive, rather than argumentative or persuasive. In serious, objective journalism, writers are often encouraged to put the most important information up front in the very first sentence so that readers can learn the essentials of a story within seconds of reading the headline. For instance, if you\\'re a journalist tasked with covering a local fire, you might begin our piece like this: \"Four apartment buildings on the 800 block of Cherry avenue suffered a severe electrical fire Saturday night. While there were no fatalities, five adults and a child were rushed to Skyline Hospital for treatment of injuries sustained in the blaze.\" By beginning with the bare essentials, you give the majority of the readers the information they want to know immediately. In the subsequent paragraphs, you can delve into the details and the context surrounding the event so that the readers who stick around can learn more.\\n4. Though all essays are unique (besides plagiarized ones), certain strategies can help you make the most of your essay based on the specific type of writing you\\'re doing. For instance, if you\\'re writing an argumentative essay — that is, one that argues a specific point with the hope of persuading the reader into agreement — it can be helpful to focus on summarizing your argument in the introductory paragraph (or paragraphs) of the essay. Doing this gives the reader a quick rundown of the logic you\\'re going to use to support your argument. For instance, if you\\'re arguing against a proposed local sales tax, you might include something like the following in your first paragraph: \"The proposed sales tax is regressive and fiscally irresponsible. By proving that the sales tax puts a disproportionate tax burden on the poor and that it has a net negative effect on the local economy, this essay intends to prove these points beyond a shadow of a doubt.\" This approach tells the reader right away what your main arguments are going to be, and this gives your argument legitimacy from the get-go.', 'question_id': 1030832, 'answer_choices': [[1, 0, 2, 3, 4], [4, 2, 0, 1, 3], [2, 3, 4, 0, 1], [1, 3, 2, 0, 4]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10308599.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

Many people will turn you down. This is just the nature of door-to-door sales. In fact, salespeople have an average “contact” rate with customers of about 30%-40%. Out of that, less than half show interest and even fewer act. You're looking at a success rate of 10% or lower. You'll have to have a golden tongue in order to persuade them. One idea is to include more information about your charity or the cause for which you are collecting. Potential customers may be more likely to buy if they can relate to your cause. Maintain a polite, respectful demeanor. Move people with your words and do not try to manipulate them – put your “frowny face” away. If a customer declines, thank them and respect their decision. Do not antagonize them with continued appeals.\\n4. As any actor knows, practice makes perfect. Frequent rehearsal makes will make your pitch more familiar to you and the whole situation less frightening. Try giving your pitch in front of a mirror, use a webcam to record yourself speaking, or practice a cold call over the phone with a friend. If you can, also ask friends to listen and make suggestions. Having an audience of real people will simulate the sales situation and ready you for the increased stress of the job.\\n5. It is very hard for a shy person to speak “off the cuff” and to improvise in most situations. Make things easier for yourself by writing out exactly what you want to say to potential buyers in advance. A short script is all you need. Try something like, “Hello, my name is Gina and I'm with the charity XYZ. Can I talk to you for a moment about our local fund-raising efforts?”\\nOnce you have a script, rehearse it as often as possible. Review the sales pitch when you have a free moment, over lunch, or during the evening. Read it aloud at least once per day. That way, it will roll off your tongue when you hit the streets.\\n6. While focusing on the task at hand, sales, you might spend some time thinking about your shyness and how it affects your behavior. What makes you shy? When do you most notice it and how does it affect your interactions? Do you stumble over your words when speaking to someone of the opposite sex, for example? Is it something that you can live with or something you'd like to resolve over time? Try making a list about situations when you've felt embarrassed or why.

Although formal education is not generally a requirement for becoming a CEO, most CEOs do have at least a college education. Consider earning a bachelor’s degree that will help you as a CEO in a particular industry, such as computer science or public policy, or simply study business administration. For example, if you want to become the CEO of a multimedia conglomerate, you might find getting a degree in communication or television to be particularly useful. Many CEOs have degrees in fields that aren’t directly related to business, but rather are related to their industry. For example, Larry Page, the CEO of Alphabet, has a bachelor’s degree in engineering and a master’s degree in computer science.\\n2. Although CEOs come from a variety of degree programs, most large corporations do prefer their CEOs to have a Masters in Business Administration (MBA). Earn a degree from an MBA program if you want to eventually be hired on by a company to serve as CEO. Having an MBA is less necessary if your plan is to found your own corporation; there are no education requirements at all for becoming a small business owner. You can typically apply to an MBA program no matter what your bachelor’s degree was in. Although business majors are sometimes stronger applicants, MBA programs accept all types of students.\\n3. v4-460px-Become-a-Software-Engineer-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Get-a-Court-Order-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n5. Communication skills, including public speaking, elocution, and being a good listener, are among the most important personal characteristics every potential CEO needs to have. Developing and honing these skills will help you to become a better CEO candidate down the line. Working with a mentor is a good way to develop these skills by consulting with someone who can help you realize what specific aspects of your communication skills need improvement. If you’re still in school, consider taking classes on rhetoric or public speaking as good opportunities to work on developing your communication skills. Trying out for plays or other dramatic performances might also be a good way to fine tune your oral performance chops.

You may experience forewarning signs an hour or two before the migraine, such as blind spots, auras, flashing lights, weakness, tingling, or even difficulty speaking.

Hooks are powerful punches that you throw from the side to catch your opponent off guard. Aim for your opponent’s cheek or jaw when you throw the punch. Make sure to lock your wrist so the back of your hand stays in line with your elbow to get the most power. Put your hands up with open palms to make it look like you don’t want to fight anymore before throwing a hook with the arm you have out in front. This can be a great way to surprise your opponent and stun them.\\n4. The most vulnerable places on the face include the eyes, ears, and nose. If you want the fight to end quickly, direct your punches toward these areas to hurt your opponent and make them less able to fight back effectively. If you have trouble hitting your opponent in the face, try going for their neck or throat to stun them. It’s okay to fight dirty if you or someone else is at risk from being hurt. Try kicking your opponent in the crotch or their knees to help take them down faster so you’re able to get away.\\n5. v4-460px-Be-Good-at-Fist-Fighting-Step-2-Version-3.jpg', 'question_id': 1031386, 'answer_choices': [[0, 5, 4, 1, 3, 2], [0, 5, 3, 1, 4, 2], [3, 1, 5, 4, 2, 0], [2, 0, 3, 4, 1, 5]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1031499.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Some assets already have beneficiaries designated. If you have purchased life insurance or opened a retirement account you undoubtedly appointed a beneficiary. This designation will trump whatever you have in the will. These assets will not need to be distributed through the will. Nevertheless, don't forget about these assets when you are deciding who gets what. Review who you named as the beneficiary on each policy or account. If you need to update the beneficiary on a life insurance policy, contact the life insurance company.\\n1. The executor or personal representative will be responsible for paying your debts out of your estate. Listing your debts will also give you a good idea of the size of your estate. Include funeral expenses in your calculation of debts. Other debts include state and federal taxes, medical expenses, mortgages and condominium fees, and credit card debt. You can roughly determine your net worth by adding the value of your assets (including your property, stock, shares, savings, life insurance policies, employee death in service benefits) and then subtracting any uninsured debts that the estate must pay. Ask a friend or family member to help you go through your list of debts. Since the executor will be responsible for handling your estate’s accounts, this will be a good test to see who has interest and aptitude in dealing with someone else’s finances.\\n2. v4-460px-Make-Writing-a-Will-Easy-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n3. Write out the three purposes of a will: to distribute assets, nominate an executor to pay debts, and plan for minor children. Even if you don’t need a will to accomplish all three, you should give some time to thinking about each. Your circumstances could change. Even if you have no assets now, you might in the future. Also, you may have children years after you draft the will.\\n4. The primary purpose of a will is to transfer assets. Without a will, those assets will pass according to state law to your heirs (typically spouse and/or children). You should create a list of both specific assets (things) and liquid assets (money). Draft a list of specific assets by walking around your house. Note objects of value that people would want: vehicles, the house itself, art, and jewelry. Draft a list of liquid assets. Liquid assets include savings accounts, checking accounts, cash deposits, and savings bonds. Note that some assets may transfer outside of probate. For example, if you own a checking account or a house in joint tenancy with a spouse, your spouse will be the sole owner of the property once you die, even without a will.\\n5. v4-460px-Make-Writing-a-Will-Easy-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n6. v4-460px-Make-Writing-a-Will-Easy-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\", 'question_id': 1031499, 'answer_choices': [[3, 2, 4, 6, 0, 5, 1], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6, 0], [6, 5, 1, 4, 3, 0, 2], [2, 1, 3, 0, 5, 4, 6]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1031501.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Be-a-Bald-and-Beautiful-Woman-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n1.

Let warm water run from your faucet for about 30 seconds so it can warm up to at least 70 °F (21 °C).

In order for parents and their children to have successful friendships, limits must be in place for the relationship. Neither you nor your parent should completely depend on the other for socialization. Consider this relationship a bonus in addition to those you have with peers your own age. To prevent children and parents from becoming enmeshed, each should maintain their own separate social lives and interests. You may be in an enmeshed relationship if you find yourself neglecting other relationships, or if your mood and self-esteem are strongly dependent on your relationship with your parents. If you feel you are in an enmeshed relationship with your parents, practice spending time alone and building up relationships with others.

Rather than living at a university, a program with homestays lets you live with a family overseas. Not only will you learn more about the language and culture by staying with a local family, but you will have daily meals and housing provided for you. In many cases, the cost of staying with a family will be cheaper than paying for housing on a campus. If you have a choice between staying on a campus or in a home, always ask for a comparison of the cost of each. Many homestays allow you to complete your laundry free of charge, and ensures that you are provided with meals everyday. Consider the pros and cons of a homestay before foregoing dorm life.

This will give you an easy way to get to the flesh of the watermelon, and the rind can be used later on to create decorations and accessories for your watermelon. Don't cut too much further than 1.5 inches (3.8 cm), or your face may appear to be a little squished. If cutting this much from the top seems to be too much for the size of watermelon you have, just slice the top off at a point that exposes the insides of the watermelon. The important part isn't how much you cut away, rather it's making sure you can access it's flesh while giving plenty of room to carve a face in the front.\\n1. v4-460px-Carve-a-Smile-on-a-Watermelon-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n2. Similar to pumpkin carving, it's helpful to draw a light outline to guide your cuts later on. Use a pencil to draw a half-moon shape for an open-mouthed smile, or a thin curved line for a more subdued grin. Don't forget the eyes! Draw round eyes for a typical smiley face look or use long oval shapes to create a classic cartoon face look, similar to Mickey Mouse. If you want your watermelon face to have a nose, draw out a small circle or triangle between the eyes and mouth. You can even add eyelashes or dimples, if desired! You can look up pumpkin carving designs if you want to get a little more fancy with the face. Carving watermelons and carving pumpkins are remarkably similar processes, and you may find that most Halloween-style designs work perfectly on a watermelon rind.\\n3. v4-460px-Carve-a-Smile-on-a-Watermelon-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n4. It's a lot harder to carve it while the watermelon still has its insides, so be sure to remove them before moving onto the face. Cut through to the inside along your pencil marks for the smile and eyes (as well as the nose and other features, if applicable) with a paring knife and set the rind pieces aside when you finish. These can be used for decorations later on. Cutting the smile before the insides are removed can scramble and mush the watermelon's meat, reducing the number of watermelon balls you can harvest.\", 'question_id': 103209, 'answer_choices': [[4, 0, 1, 2, 3], [4, 0, 2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 0, 4, 1], [2, 1, 0, 3, 4]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10322051.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Avoid-Baggage-Fees-Step-4.jpg\\n1.

For instance, if someone asks how much you earn, you could say, “Half of what I’m worth.”\\nIf you can’t think of a clever response on the spot, laugh gently at their question as if you thought it was a joke.

A workplace is an easy environment to leave a conversation because you always have the option to say you need to go do some work.

At different stages of your life, you are often regularly asked the same questions over and over.

If your bump feels hard and fleshy, it might be a wart. Soft bumps that feel like they have liquid inside are blisters, abscesses, pimples, or cysts. Wash your hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds after touching a wart or the skin around it. It's easy to spread the viruses that cause warts.\\n3. Warts are fleshy bumps of skin that may be light gray or the same color as your skin. They're usually small, and range in size from 1 to 10 mm (0.039 to 0.394 in). You might notice a single wart, or see them growing in clusters. Warts don't have heads like pimples, but there might be a small black dot in the bump that looks like a tiny seed. Sometimes, the blood that feeds a wart dries inside and forms a small black spot. Warts are caused by viruses; different viruses cause different kinds of warts and affect various parts of the body.\\n4. While warts are often treatable at home, you should see a doctor if warts are widespread, hurt, or if they don't respond to home treatment. A widespread outbreak of warts could indicate an immune system issue. Additionally, you should always see a doctor if you believe you have genital warts. Dark or multi-colored, irregularly shaped warts can sometimes resemble some forms of skin cancer, so your doctor might want to take a biopsy, or a small tissue sample, just to stay on the safe side.\\n5. v4-460px-Identify-Warts-Step-2.jpg\\n6. The texture of the surface can help you and your doctor determine the best course of treatment. Common warts are usually rough or grainy, a bit like the texture of cauliflower. Some warts are smooth, flat and skinny, while others look like clusters of little threads or strings. Common warts, which usually have rough surfaces, are often easily treated with over-the-counter medication. Other warts might require alternative treatment methods, such as medication that boosts the immune system.\", 'question_id': 10323918, 'answer_choices': [[3, 5, 2, 0, 6, 1, 4], [6, 4, 0, 2, 5, 1, 3], [4, 1, 5, 3, 6, 0, 2], [3, 0, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10323.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

This means letting go of things you cannot control and embracing spontaneity. Living in the moment can add an element of excitement and engagement in your life that you may have been missing. One way to live more in the moment is to create a bucket list of five to ten things you have always wanted to do and set a timeline for doing them. Keep the items reasonable, as you want them to be things you can achieve. Your list may have things like “traveling solo for a month” or “competing in the slam poetry competition at school”. Focus on things you can achieve and then pursue them.\\n1. v4-460px-Become-Visual-Kei-or-J-Rocker-as-an-American-Guy-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Choose-a-Massage-Continuing-Education-Class-Step-3.jpg\\n3. To boost your sense of happiness, you can start your day with one to two positive affirmations. These affirmations could be simple \"I\" statements about something you are happy about or grateful for, as well as statements about positive things you intend to do that day. For example, you may look in the mirror in the morning and say, \"I am powerful and strong\" or \"I am going to do exciting things today.\" You may also want to put up inspirational posters and visuals that contain positive messages in your living space or your work space.

Instructions like “replace the peripheral flange bracket” are useless to you if you can’t remember how the bracket came off. To make things easier, develop a system for your parts. Make notes or take a picture with a camera or your phone before you remove them. Then, as you set them aside, keep them ordered the same way you removed them. Try marking the parts with a tag or something like nail polish to indicate alignment. Store parts in a safe spot, such as in plastic bags on a workbench.\\n1. Thanks to the Internet, car repair resources are very accessible. You will probably find quite a few videos of people going through the repair process, which can help you learn about parts and tools or figure out what steps you need to take to complete a repair. Many videos are made by amateur car enthusiasts. They may not have much experience or professional training. Make sure you reference videos with official resources like a repair manual.\\n2. Nothing is more of a pain than being elbow-deep in grease and realizing you need a cheap tool you don’t have. Some back and forth is inevitable with car repairs, but gathering a few basic tools can prevent a lot of this. Socket wrenches, screwdrivers, wrenches, pliers, jacks, penetrating oil, and a rubber mallet are some tools that will help you get through most common issues. Keep in mind what repair you need to make. If you’re changing a fuse, for instance, you will need to buy a new fuse. If you’re changing the oil, you need an oil pan. Check with your local auto parts store to see what kind of tool rental program they have. These programs provide a way to borrow expensive tools without having to buy them.\\n3. If something seems wrong, inspect it right away! Letting a problem go can lead to more extensive damage. Look and listen for issues while driving the vehicle. A rattling noise may be a sign of loose nuts or bolts while grinding can be the brake pads, for instance. The check engine light should not be taken lightly. If it comes on, inspect your car as soon as possible. Use your car’s symptoms to diagnose your car. If your car lacks power, you know it is likely an issue with the electrical system, such as a dead battery or blown fuse. Get a diagnostic reader to easily locate problems. Auto part store employees have these and will even rent them to you. You can also buy your own online.\\n4. v4-460px-Repair-Your-Own-Car-Without-Experience-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Repair-Your-Own-Car-Without-Experience-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n6. v4-460px-Repair-Your-Own-Car-Without-Experience-Step-2-Version-2.jpg', 'question_id': 1032921, 'answer_choices': [[1, 6, 0, 4, 3, 2, 5], [5, 4, 1, 0, 2, 3, 6], [6, 2, 1, 3, 5, 0, 4], [2, 6, 1, 4, 0, 5, 3]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10329326.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. These devices emit a high frequency sound that deters animals such as birds. Ultrasonic pet repellents don’t affect humans at all.

Tall grasses around the pool can be effective at keeping the ducks out. This is because, from the point of view of a duck, the tall grasses could be hiding predators, and therefore the ducks will be less likely to go into the pool.\\n3. Feeding any birds, including ducks, will inevitably make them want to stick around and use the pool. Shoo away any ducks that venture into the garden, and also remove any hanging bird feeders from the trees. Feeding ducks will entice them to keep returning, and possibly to nest in the yard too.

Hearing your voice is important to the development of your baby’s nervous system. It also can soothe and calm your baby, which can promote bonding. Talk, sing, and read to your baby whenever you have the chance. Respond to your baby’s babbles or coos to let him or her know you hear it. Say, “what’s that, Christopher, you want to hear some music? Ok, let’s listen to some waves on the beach.” You could also use this opportunity to sing your child a favorite song. Make sure to keep the mood light and happy and laugh when you get a chance.

Bonding with your baby doesn't just happen overnight. In fact, it’s a process. It can happen at birth or even a few weeks or months later, sometimes in the process of everyday caregiving. At some point, you’ll realized how much you love your baby and want to protect him or her. Recognize that is it normal to not bond immediately and to even have negative feelings about your baby. As long as your negative feelings don’t manifest themselves as wanting to hurt your baby, this is fine. If you do want to hurt your baby, seek immediate medical attention. Remember to be patient and understanding with your partner. Every parent has a different experience bonding with a baby. Your partner may bond immediately with your baby or it might take longer. In either case, try to focus on your bond with your baby rather than on your partner's bond with your baby. Avoid concern if you are an adoptive parent. Bonding with your baby may take a bit longer, but the process is the same as with biological parents.\\n4. Touch is an early type of language between a baby and parents. It soothes both of you and can also promote healthy growth and development. Cradle, hold, and touch your baby as often as you can to help establish the bond. Give your baby “skin to skin” contact if you can. This means holding your baby’s bare skin directly against your own bare skin during feeding or cradling times. You can start this as early as following delivery. Rock and stroke your baby during feeding and cradling times. Make sure to keep both gentle so that you don’t harm or startle your baby. Recognize that touch is especially important for premature babies and those with medical problems. If you can’t hold your baby, ask the doctor if you can touch him or her or even try to give a gentle massage in the isolette.\\n5. v4-460px-Bond-With-Your-Baby-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\", 'question_id': 1033127, 'answer_choices': [[5, 1, 2, 0, 4, 3], [0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4], [3, 5, 4, 1, 0, 2], [0, 4, 3, 1, 5, 2]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10331779.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

Antique linens will soften the hard lines of your bathroom, add a touch of class, and serve as a conversation point for guests. Hang your hand towels on a tiered towel rack, and then intersperse them with the linens to add some texture to your bathroom design. If you don’t have any of your own antique linens, you can usually find them in antique stores. Look for linens with detailed hand embroidery.\\n4. Adding mirrors to your bathroom helps give the illusion of depth to what could be an otherwise monochromatic and potentially claustrophobic space. A mirror with an embellished frame not only adds depth, it adds a touch of character to the space as well. You can add a single, large mirror over your vanity or try hanging a few smaller mirrors around your bathroom. You could also try hanging several small mirrors in a pattern on one wall. Try choosing an unconventional shape or painting the outside of the mirror to add a pop of color.\\n5. You can probably use nails or thumbtacks for lighter tapestries or blankets. For heavier ones, you can mount a curtain rod on the wall by following the instructions in the curtain rod’s packaging. Regardless, make sure to mark off where you want your tapestry or blanket beforehand to ensure that it is level when you hang it. If the tapestry or blanket is particularly delicate, you can stretch it over a frame and hang the frame. You can find frames at most craft stores.', 'question_id': 10332198, 'answer_choices': [[3, 4, 0, 2, 5, 1], [3, 0, 4, 1, 5, 2], [4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 0], [4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 0]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10332207.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. If you have a few favorite types of crystals and have several in your collection, it may work best for you to sort your collection based on individual crystal type. You can also arrange your crystals based on size. Put the large crystals toward the back, and place the small ones along the front. For instance, do this if you have a lot of amethyst, tourmaline, or smoky quartz.\\n1. An easy and efficient way to separate your crystals is by their finishing method. Some crystals have a shiny, smooth outside, and they go through a polishing process to tumble them. Raw crystals refer to stones that are not tumbled and still look as if they came out of the ground. Separate your crystals based on these categories before you place them in your storage solution. In addition, some crystals such as Selenite or Labradorite are really sensitive and can break easily. For instance, you can place all of your tumbled stones in a box and put your raw specimens on a bookshelf.\\n2. v4-460px-Store-Crystals-Step-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10332207, 'answer_choices': [[2, 1, 0], [2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [1, 2, 0]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10332218.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

Since white walls serve as a great backdrop for artwork, you can take advantage of this in your home by hanging lots of pictures, paintings, or other framed items on the walls. Let the white walls lead the eye to the artwork or pictures. Make sure to space out the pictures so that there will be at least 6 inches (15 cm) of white space between each of them. If you have a large picture or piece of artwork, then choose a wall to hang it on and don’t hang anything else on that wall. You might even leave the other walls bare so that nothing in the room will compete with this picture. For a fun, bold look, you can create a “gallery wall” with 3 or more art pieces or photographs (or even a mixture of both). You could also hang a decorative tapestry on the wall. This could be a woven macramé, an ornate rug, an actual tapestry, or even a beautiful scarf or shawl. In addition to being decorative, the cloth can also help reduce echo in the room.\\n2. v4-460px-Decorate-White-Walls-Step-8.jpg\\n3. White walls are the perfect backdrop for a special quote, design, or monogram. You can get stencils and acrylic paint to decorate white walls with the text or design of your choice, or you can choose premade decals to stick the text and designs you want directly onto your walls. Make sure your walls are clean and dry before applying stencils or decals. Use a wet paper towel or washcloth to wipe down the walls. Then, dry the walls with a paper towel or clean, dry towel. Choose a position on the wall where the text and designs will be easily visible and not in the way of anything you want to hang on the wall. Also, don’t place the decals in an area where furniture might cover them. If you have a kitchen with white walls, try putting up a chalkboard decal on one of the walls. You can use it to write grocery lists, menus, or notes. This would also work well in a home office.\\n4. v4-460px-Decorate-White-Walls-Step-4.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Decorate-White-Walls-Step-6.jpg\\n6. If you have white walls, you also have the option of going crazy with color! You can choose eclectic pieces in a variety of colors and sprinkle them throughout the room for all-over color. Choose colorful pictures, bright throw pillows, and bold colored ceramic items to place throughout the room. To add colorful accents to the bedroom, you could cover the bed with throw pillows in the same colors as a painting on the wall, such as bright green, yellow, pink, and blue throw pillows. For colorful accents in the living room, cover a wall with several colorful paintings in brightly-colored picture frames. To make a white bathroom more colorful, choose a multicolor shower curtain with a brightly-colored bath rug.\\n7. You can hang any color curtains you like in a white room, but you may want to choose curtains that will complement the rest of your décor. For instance, pick navy curtains to complement a navy and white rug. If you want your white room to pop with red, then get some bright red curtains. You can try floor length curtains, window length curtains, or shorter than window length curtains that let in lots of extra light! Opt for opaque curtains to make the room dark, such as when you are sleeping, or sheer curtains to let in lots of natural light, such as in your kitchen or living room.

You can take basic computer courses in college to learn how to use word processors, learn coding, perform research, and use databases. Scientists use computers as tools for research, data collection, and communication. You’ll also need to communicate with colleagues, employers, and paleontological organizations through email. You need to know how to use satellite-based geographic information systems (GIS). This is used in managing databases for fossils and collections data. You’ll have to take classes in college to learn digital mapping.\\n1. To become a paleontologist, you need to first graduate high school before you go to college. In high school, you should try to do well in math and science, because a strong background in these subjects will set you up for better success as a student in college. To get accepted to a college with a decent science program, you need to maintain good grades throughout your years in high school.\\n2. v4-460px-Become-a-Judge-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\\n3. To pursue a graduate degree in paleontology, you need to take classes with an emphasis on paleontology such as integrative biology, earth and planetary sciences, and geography. Many universities do not have paleontology departments. Graduate students work with their faculty guidance committee to receive the training they need for their specialization. Individual universities have their own requirements for people seeking graduate degrees in paleontology. Searching a university’s website for the graduate programs is your best bet. One example is UC Berkeley’s program. They offer masters degrees in paleontology through their integrative biology and geography departments. For example, to qualify for an advanced degree in paleontology, you need to take courses from the geography, geology, and biology departments. These courses may include mineral sciences, zoology, evolutionary paleo-biology, structural geology, vertebrate and invertebrate paleontology, and so on. You can also study abroad through a variety of programs such as Geophysicists in Brazil, Geologists in Columbia, Petroleum Engineers in Bolivia, Petroleum Engineers in Romania, and Petroleum Engineers in Spain.\\n4. v4-460px-Become-a-Senator-Step-5-Version-3.jpg', 'question_id': 10333207, 'answer_choices': [[2, 4, 1, 0, 3], [1, 2, 0, 4, 3], [2, 3, 4, 0, 1], [2, 3, 0, 1, 4]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10333.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Pay-Your-Respects-when-Someone-You-Know-Dies-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\\n1. It is typical for everyone at the memorial service to pay their respects by viewing the body. This may take place before, during, or after the service. If you want to see the deceased one last time, you may go up when directed and view the body. If you don’t want to take part in this practice, remain seated. In some situations, a viewing, or wake, may be held immediately before the memorial or on a separate day. Wakes are usually more intimate but allow you to come and go as you please.

If you have never attended a funeral, or if you are a bit shaken by the death, it may be a good idea to bring someone with you. A parent, sibling, or friend can accompany you to the memorial and offer comfort if you need it. Another good option is to go with someone who has a similar relationship with the deceased as you.

If your vehicle has been sitting in the sun all day and you drive it into your garage, it acts as a massive radiator. Leaving your car outside until it has cooled off can prevent the temperature in the garage from increasing. If you’re in a hurry to get your car into your garage, try pouring some cold water on the roof of the car to cool it off.\\n2. This is the simplest way to decrease the temperature. Just open the door to increase the airflow and allow the hot air to be exchanged for cooler air. For security reasons, close the garage door at night.\\n3. When a room has a high humidity level, it makes the temperature feel significantly higher than it really is. Look for a dehumidifier that can run on a preset program so you don’t have to constantly adjust it. Humidifiers work by drawing moisture out of the air and sending back clean dry air. They normally store the moisture that they collect in a tray at the bottom of the unit. Once the unit is full of water, the dehumidifier stops working, so make sure that you empty the water out of it every day.

Washing the deity of Krishna and dressing it in new clothes is another important aspect of Janmashtami as it’s celebrated in many temples. Take part in this cleaning and clothing process if you’re unable or unwilling to help decorate the temple or read from religious scripture. The deity is bathed in a variety of auspicious liquids, including fragrant water, milk, or honey. This ablution ceremony is called the abhisheka.

Place the samples throughout your home and in various lighting conditions. Compare the look of the carpet throughout the day to get a sense of which you prefer. Then, make your decision based on personal preference. This way, you can get a clear sense of what the carpet looks like before you install it. Keep the swatches for a few days so you can see what it looks like at different times of day and lighting. Be sure to return the swatches to the store after you make your decision.\\n2. v4-460px-Choose-Carpet-Color-Step-4.jpg\\n3. Using existing features in your room is a great way to narrow down color choices. Think about the paint, furniture, art, drapes, and decorations in the room. Select a shade that is in the same color family as other items in the room so everything looks cohesive. For example, if you have a sofa that you want to showcase, go with a neutral carpet that won’t distract from the couch. If your sofa is red, the walls are grey, and you have dark or black furniture, choose a charcoal carpet. However, don’t pick the carpet based solely on your decor if you change it often or plan to change it soon.

To get your brush wet, first, let the water run over it for 30 seconds or so. This makes it easier to pull the hair off of the bristles.

Taking a thorough inventory of what you have in your closet can help you to identify items that are part of your old style aesthetic. By sorting through everything you have, you can pare down your wardrobe to items that suit your new desired style aesthetic. Try dumping out everything in your closet onto your bed or the floor so that you can look at each item 1 by 1. If it’s something you like and want to keep, hang it back in your closet. If it’s something you no longer enjoy wearing, put it into your donate or sell pile.Tip: Keep in mind that expanding on your current closet will be a lot cheaper and easier to do than buying a whole new collection of clothes. There are ways to make old clothes look completely new by altering, dyeing, or simply pairing them with different clothes.\\n1. v4-460px-Reinvent-Your-Style-Aesthetic-Step-6.jpg\\n2. A jacket is a great investment since you can wear it with lots of different outfits. Opt for a jacket that reflects the new style aesthetic you’re going for and make sure that it’s something you’ll love wearing! For example, you might opt for a black leather jacket if you're going for an edgy, biker look. Or, you might opt for a stylish blazer if you want to look polished and professional. Also, make sure to consider the climate where you live. If you live in a cold climate, you might opt for a warm jacket that you can layer as needed and wear from fall through spring. If you’re in a warm climate, you might opt for a lightweight jacket that you can wear over a tank top or t-shirt or layer up with long-sleeved shirts and sweaters in cooler weather.\\n3. v4-460px-Reinvent-Your-Style-Aesthetic-Step-2.jpg\\n4. Once you’ve acquired some new items that reflect your new look, start incorporating them into your wardrobe. Mix and match the pieces to create the look you want. When formulating your signature style, decide whether you want to completely change it up, or expand on your current wardrobe. For example, maybe you already have the classy aesthetic you want, but you just want to fine tune it and make it completely yours. Or maybe you’ve been dressing preppy all your life and you want to turn it around entirely and go for a more vintage, retro look.\\n5. v4-460px-Reinvent-Your-Style-Aesthetic-Step-4.jpg\", 'question_id': 10336930, 'answer_choices': [[0, 3, 4, 5, 2, 1], [0, 1, 4, 5, 2, 3], [5, 0, 2, 3, 1, 4], [2, 1, 0, 5, 4, 3]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10337138.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. 459px-Hijabi-Woman-Says-No.png\\n1. Avoid simply telling them what they shouldn\\'t do; also tell them what they can do. This helps them find a better outlet for their feelings, and helps them picture what they can do instead. You might say something like... \\n\"Don\\'t hit Dad! Hit the couch.\" \"No pushing me! It hurts! Go push the wall.\"\\n2. If an autistic child is melting down, they are in a state of total panic. They can\\'t process lectures or wordy discussions, because they are too overwhelmed to listen to reason. Limit your words to short sentences, until the child has calmed down. Example of unhelpful speech during a meltdown: \"It is not okay to hurt your brother! That hurt him. Hurting people is wrong. I am very disappointed in you. I raised you better than this. You need to say sorry!\" Example of helpful speech: \"No hitting people! Go hit the couch.\" (An apology can come later.)\\n3. If the child has a \"safe place\" to retreat to, such as their room or a favorite corner, then it may help for them to go there. The child will probably want alone time once they\\'ve escaped. Help make sure that other people know to leave the child in peace for a while.\\n4. 459px-Teen-Comforts-Sad-Child.png\\n5. Many aggressive incidents happen when a child is overwhelmed and panicky, and cannot handle the stress they\\'re under. It helps if the people around them can be a calming influence. Work on cultivating an attitude of calm compassion. Take some deep breaths, and compose yourself as best as you can. Remember that their behavior isn\\'t a negative reflection on you. All kids act out, even under the care of good people. Treat this like an expression of frustration or panic or overwhelm, rather than hatred or rebellion. Avoid adversarial behavior, like yelling, making ultimatums, or taking away privileges. Punishment tends to make the child even more agitated. Keep your cool and focus on de-escalation. It\\'s better to leave than to scream at a child. Say, \"I am overwhelmed. I need to take a break,\" and leave the room until you can handle yourself. Modeling this kind of self awareness and control also helps the child learn that everyone needs breaks to calm down, at times.\\n6. 459px-Child-Speaks-Tangled-Words.png\\n7. If they are melting down, then let them calm down first, and if they are acting out, you can ask now. First, ask why they were upset, and why they hurt the person, and listen. Then, explain that hurting people is not okay. Tell them a better way to handle the situation, so they know what to do next time. Calming down after a meltdown may take an hour or two. This is normal, and the best way to help is by giving them space and alone time. Ask why they did it. Sometimes, a child just needs you to stay and listen while they \"cry it out\" or just sit with you. They may want you to sit next to them or hold them while they cry. They may be able to express what\\'s really bothering them after they can let out their feelings. The child\\'s explanation is very important. It can help you figure out the source of the problem, and how to make things better. For example, if the child hit Auntie because Auntie was going to kiss them even though they were protesting, maybe someone should talk to Auntie about respecting the child\\'s boundaries.\\n8. 459px-Person-Wants-Not-To-Be-Touched.png', 'question_id': 10337138, 'answer_choices': [[4, 5, 0, 6, 7, 1, 8, 2, 3], [5, 0, 1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 8, 7], [2, 8, 0, 6, 4, 5, 7, 1, 3], [6, 1, 5, 8, 4, 3, 0, 2, 7]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1033716.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Tighten-Skin-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Tighten-Skin-Step-4.jpg\\n2.

This is the act of changing the meaning of a word in the middle of an argument and using that changed meaning to support a conclusion. For example, if you are defending your position in this debate on the basis of what the words “marriage” or “love” or “family” mean to you, then you should use their meanings consistently. These words can mean different things to different people, and changing their meaning in the middle of an argument will lead to the fallacy of equivocation.\\n1.

Whatever job you end up taking, you’ll want it to ultimately help you reach the goals you’ve set for yourself in the long term. Keep a list or “map” of these goals nearby and refer to it continually as you decide between the two offers. For example, your long-term career goal may be to become the CEO of a major company. If this is your goal, then you’ll want to consider whether or not each of the jobs you’re considering helps you to eventually achieve that goal. Try to make goals as detailed as possible, as this will make it easier to figure out how to work towards them in a concrete way. For instance, if you want to be a CEO, write down the specific industry, or if possible the actual company, you want to work in.\\n3. You may have short-term goals you want your next job to accomplish, such as just having a source of income, but you should also keep your long-term plans in mind as you try to decide between two job offers. Ideally, you’ll want to choose the job that offers you perks, benefits, and experiences that also help you to achieve your goals in the long run. For example, if your goal is to eventually become a high-level manager of a company, choose the job that gives you some of your short-term goals (e.g., a short commute, decent health insurance) while also giving you the skills and experience you can use to achieve your long-term goals. When considering job offers, always ask yourself what opportunities for growth or moving up in an organization each job offers you.

Since black soap can be a little drying, you should follow up with a lightweight moisturizer. In addition to keeping your skin hydrated, this can help seal in the nutrients left behind from the vegetable-based black soap. If you’re washing your face with the black soap, use a moisturizer specifically designed for use on your face. The skin on the rest of your body is thicker, so body lotions tends to be much too heavy for use on your face.\\n1. Black soap contains ingredients like palm kernel oil and coconut oil, both of which contain lauric acid. The lauric acid creates a natural, foamy lather when you rub the soap between your wet hands.

If you resent the person for the harm he or she has caused, then you'll never be able to move on, both in your own life and in continuing your relationship. Accept that what has been done is done, by saying things like, “I am angry because __ broke my trust and I accept that this has happened” and “I accept what has happened and how it made me feel”. Accept what the person has done to you and recognize that you have no control over it. However, you can control how you react to the situation. Recognize your own flaws and possible ways you have hurt people to help you accept the wrongdoing and release your resentment. Everyone makes mistakes, and recognizing your own mistakes will help you understand the mistakes the person who hurt you. It won't happen overnight, but the sooner you aim to let go of your resentment, the sooner it will become a priority. Focus moving forward instead of stewing.\\n2. Do you enjoy spending time with the person because they are funny or you have intelligent conversations together? Do you make a good team raising your children? Are you sexually satisfied? Make a list of all the great things about your platonic or romantic relationship with the person who has hurt you. Assess whether the good outweighs the the thing(s) they did to hurt you. Start by noting smaller positive attributes, such as, “they take the trash out” or “they send me helpful links at work”, then move into bigger positive attributes such as personality or good deeds they do.\\n3. v4-460px-Forgive-Someone-Who-Has-Hurt-You-Step-4-Version-5.jpg\\n4. Another important aspect of forgiving someone is being able to take some time to just be alone with your thoughts. If someone has really wronged you, whether your boyfriend has cheated on you or your best friend has been saying hurtful things behind your back, it's important to take some time to get space and spend some time on your own. Additionally, overtime, you might gain perspective on the situation. For example, in the moment, certain words said by your partner or friend may have seemed especially hurtful. Yet, over time and thinking them over, you might understand why they said the hurtful thing. If you live with that person who has hurt you, you may need to find another place to stay for a while, if possible.

On modern brass pieces, an outer coating of lacquer serves as a layer of protection against oxidation. But, older, antique pieces of brass typically don't have a lacquered coating. You can assess if a brass piece is lacquered by looking at its surface: it will have a clear finish covering the entire piece. Brass covered with lacquer will usually only tarnish if there is a crack in the lacquer coating. Lacquered brass is fairly easy to clean; all you really need is some soapy water. However, you might want to consider removing the lacquering if tarnish has formed underneath the lacquer finish.

Part of becoming a celebrity is about who you know and who is helping you achieve your goal. This doesn't necessarily mean befriending a celebrity, but it is good to find someone in the industry to act as a sort of mentor, to help you avoid pitfalls. You'll want to hire, or at least speak with a marketing professional, since a lot of getting famous comes through marketing yourself and you'll want, if possible, to have an expert's opinion on how best to market yourself. You really will want to acquire a mentor of some sort, someone who has experience with the area in which you're interested in becoming a celebrity. For example: if you're wanting to become a published (and celebrity) author, seek advice from other writers.

There is a lot of the same old same old out there, and it is true that copy cats can become well known (think the many copy cats of books like Twilight or Harry Potter), but it's the original product that is remembered the best. You also need to put a lot of effort into this. This means, you can use the work of others as a jumping off place. You'll need to add your own flare, or individuality to what you're presenting. For example: if you want to write a vampire novel, that's great! But instead of copying the Anne Rice or Twilight formula of pretty immortal vampires, come up with something unusual about your vampires, something that readers will be intrigued by and remember. Being creative basically means having something that people will remember, because it stands out. Of course, this can backfire if you're too focused on complete originality (there is no such thing), but you should tease out what specific and original thing you have to offer, because that will help when you're selling your project.\\n3. v4-460px-Become-a-Celebrity-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\\n4. There are lots of different kinds of celebrities from singers and actors to bloggers, fiction writers, humanitarians, models, or, even, chefs.

It's also good to decide whether you're looking for that 15 minutes of fame or whether you want your celebrity to be a lifelong endeavor.

Take a large piece of plastic wrap and press it down into the bowl so it is touching the icing. Then secure the edges of the plastic wrap around the rim of the bowl. If you do this, there is no need to use a damp dishcloth, as the moisture from the cloth won’t benefit the icing through the plastic wrap.

After remixing the icing, if it isn’t smooth and has an off consistency, chances are it has gone bad and needs to be discarded.

Stick to your own regular bedtimes and invite them to do so, as well. Additionally, allow them to sleep whenever they can, even if it's at odd hours.

Use basic image editing software, to resize your image, add effects, change colors, or make any corrections you want, until your image is just right. The image you use can be an image from one of the many internet sites that offer transfer image options, or an image you provide yourself. As long as you can print it from your printer at home (and have the legal rights to use that image), you can transfer the image onto your fabric.\\n1. v4-460px-Make-and-Use-Iron-on-Transfers-Step-2-Version-8.jpg\\n2. The easiest way to make transfer clothing is by simply buying already packaged transfer kits at a crafts store, art stores, and big box retailers. These kits usually supply you with everything you need to do your own transfers including image software, some transfer paper, and maybe even a t-shirt. You can opt to use these helpful craft store kits, or go the route of creating your own transfer images, buying the specific kind of paper you want, and using your own clothing. In a nutshell, iron-on transfers are images that can be impressed on fabric. On one side is paper, and on the other is the image that will be ironed on and transferred in reverse. After placing the transfer paper on the fabric and running over the back of the paper with an iron, the image is transferred by heat to the fabric.\\n3. v4-460px-Make-and-Use-Iron-on-Transfers-Step-6-Version-8.jpg\\n4. Transfer paper comes in two different variations: transfer sheets to be used on light colored fabrics, and transfer sheets to be used on dark colored fabrics. Using the right kind of transfers sheets can help ensure that you get the best looking results from your iron on transfer. For example:\\nTransfer sheets meant to be used on light fabrics are meant for fabrics that are white, yellow, light gray, or any other fabric that is light in nature. The transfer paper used for light colored fabrics is transparent. This means any areas of your image that contain the color white will instead appear clear once ironed on to the shirt. The fabric color will show through rather than the white coloring of the image. If your transfer design has any light colors (other than white), the image may seem distorted and discolored once it is transferred onto the fabric. Try to use medium to dark colors when using this kind of transfer paper, so the resulting image is bold and clear. Consider trimming close to the edges of your design, because the transparent areas of the paper surrounding the design can still be seen on the fabric. Transfer sheets meant to be used on dark fabrics are meant for black, dark gray, dark blue, or any other dark colored fabrics. These paper sheets are thicker, and have a white backing so the color white and other light colors can show up distinctly on the darker fabric. The caveat with using this kind of transfer paper is that any background areas of your image will appear white rather than translucent. This means you'll have to carefully cut around and inside any letters or other design elements if you want the color of the shirt to show through a certain spot rather than the color white. For example, if you were printing letters, you would need to cut out the space inside an 'O' or an 'R'. Or, you could have the solid white colored background as part of your design. However, more often than not, the white background isn't the intended look for using iron on transfers on dark fabrics.

They treat autistic children like curiosities or monsters instead of people with feelings, wants, needs, and personal space. They sympathize with or make excuses for people who abuse autistic children. They promote or partner with organizations that do these things.\\n1. Fully understanding autism is important before you start jumping to any conclusions. Look through a list of autistic traits from a trusted source, and write down what traits apply to you. Determine if you’ve been suppressing your autistic traits. Many autistic people, diagnosed or not, suppress stimming, force themselves to make eye contact, and try to pass as non-autistic.\\n2. 459px-Autism-Acceptance-Group.png\\n3. 459px-Autism-Discussion-Space.png\\n4. 459px-Man-in-Green-Talking.png\\n5.

To perform this experiment you will need 4 celery stalks, food coloring, water, a knife/scissors, and 4 small glasses. The number of glasses you need is dependent upon how many colors you want to use to change the celery. Make sure your celery stalks still have the leafy tops on them. If you only have 1 stalk of celery, you can it lengthwise into multiple pieces. Blue and red food coloring work best for this experiment, but you can use any combination of colors you would like.\\n2. You want to use a fresh part of the stalk and expose the bottom so that it can take up the most water. Ask a parent to assist with this step. Using scissors or a knife, trim the curved part of the bottom of the stalk off. Leave the leafy top on the stalk.

Every essay should be controlled by a clear, concise thesis statement. Even if your basis for comparison was assigned to you, you need to express in a single sentence why you are comparing the two items. The comparison should reveal something about the nature of the items or their relationship to each other, and your thesis statement should express that argument. Your thesis needs to make a claim about your subjects that you will then defend in your essay. It\\'s good for this claim to be a bit controversial or up for interpretation, as this allows you to build a good argument.\\n1. v4-460px-Write-a-Comparative-Essay-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n2. You may have a great idea for a paper in your head, but if it doesn\\'t perfectly match the prompt, you may not create the product your instructor has asked for. Look over the prompt (and rubric, if you have one) carefully and underline key phrases. Keep a list of these things by you as you work. Many comparative essay assignments will signal their purpose by using words such as \"compare,\" \"contrast,\" \"similarities,\" and \"differences\" in the language of the prompt. Also see whether there are any limits placed on your topic.

He received his PhD in English Literature and Medieval Studies from the University of Texas at Austin in 2014. Christopher Taylor, PhD\\t\\t\\tAdjunct Assistant Professor of English\\t\\t\\t\\tChristopher Taylor tells us: \"Start by making sure you understand the specific directions of your assignment. Then list the similarities and differences between your central items and look for patterns in order to find an argument.\"\\n3. Showing the similarities between the two subjects is the essence of a comparison paper, but you also need to recognize their differences. Making an effective comparison requires that you examine the differences between the subjects, as well. By examining the contrast between your subjects, you can provide valuable insights into how they relate to each other. The best place to start is to write a list of things that the items you are comparing have in common as well as differences between them.\\n4. This provides the context for your comparison: how will you examine these two things? Among other things, the basis could be a theoretical approach, such as feminism or multiculturalism; a question or problem that you wish to discover an answer for; or a historical theme, such as colonialism or emancipation.The comparison needs to have a specific thesis or overarching idea that determines the reason why you are comparing the two (or more) objects. The basis for your comparison may be assigned to you. Be sure to check your assignment or prompt. A basis for comparison may have to do with a theme, characteristics, or details about two different things. A basis for comparison may also be known as the “grounds” for comparison or a frame of reference. Keep in mind that comparing 2 things that are too similar makes it hard to write an effective paper. The goal of a comparison paper is to draw interesting parallels and help the reader realize something interesting about our world. This means your subjects must be different enough to make your argument interesting.\\n5. v4-460px-Write-a-Comparative-Essay-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n6. v4-460px-Write-a-Comparative-Essay-Step-4-Version-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10343, 'answer_choices': [[3, 6, 1, 4, 0, 5, 2], [1, 2, 5, 4, 0, 6, 3], [6, 0, 2, 1, 5, 3, 4], [2, 5, 3, 6, 4, 1, 0]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10345084.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Many campuses have career counselors who are trained to help you decide on a career path. They can help you narrow down your choices based on your abilities, your personality, and your preferences. Look for your career counseling center on campus and make an appointment. For instance, if you have a laid back personality and are slow to anger, you may be a good fit for pediatrics, and a career counselor can help you figure that out.\\n1. As you narrow down your choices, ask to meet with people who actually work in the specialties you're leaning towards. Talk to them about why they chose their specialty and what they like and don't like about it. Ask what their normal days look like and how stressful their field is. Try asking doctors you already know to sit down with you for a few minutes. If you don't know anyone with the specialty you'd like to explore, ask a doctor or a professor you know to introduce you to someone they know with that specialty. For example, maybe you're interested in pediatrics. Talk to doctors who have sub-specialties in the field, such as adolescent medicine or pediatric cardiology. Check at a local hospital that focuses on that specialty, such as a children's hospital.\\n2. To help you understand each area better, you need to gather as much information as you can. Listening to general lectures on campus from doctors in different fields can help give you an idea of whether that specialty is the right one for you or not. Early on in medical school, you'll be taking your core classes, so you won't have as much exposure to specialties unless you actively seek them out. For instance, if you hear about a lecture on geriatric medicine or pediatric dermatology, attend those lectures! Look for specialties that you’re naturally curious about or those that have research that attracts you.\\n3. v4-460px-Choose-a-Medical-Specialty-Step-6.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Choose-a-Medical-Specialty-Step-4.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Choose-a-Medical-Specialty-Step-2.jpg\", 'question_id': 10345084, 'answer_choices': [[2, 1, 3, 4, 0, 5], [5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 0], [2, 5, 1, 4, 0, 3], [2, 0, 1, 4, 3, 5]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10345098.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-459px-Store-Dough-Step-4.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Store-Dough-Step-2.jpg\\n2.

You can peel the sweet potatoes or leave the skin on. It doesn’t matter how the potatoes were cut—they could be diced, in large chunks, or even in wedges.

Expose the blade of the rotary cutter if it has a shield, and place your suede on a flat surface that you don't mind cutting up.

Many people choose the life of a recluse to fuel their own creativity. Without the distractions of socialization, you can focus more on your own creative work. If you're a writer, painter, sculptor, or any other creative type, use your reclusive nature to better your work. Alone time forces you to think deeply. The most interesting art, writing, and music asks difficult questions about the nature of human existence. If you're constantly filling your time with distractions, this can inhibit your creativity as it stops you from considering deeper aspects of existence. If you're alone, you'll have more time to ponder. You can also take your alone time as an opportunity to learn things that will enhance your work. If you're writing a memoir, for example, learning from other authors is important. If you've never had time to read all of Proust's work, your newfound life as a recluse can allow you to do so.\\n2. v4-460px-Be-a-Recluse-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n3. Part of what makes being alone hard is that troublesome, unwanted thoughts can creep in if we're alone for too long. You need to have some ability to self-soothe. Thinking back to your childhood can help. As children are frequently navigating new and difficult thoughts for the first time, they often have better self-soothing rituals than adults. Try to remember how you relaxed as a child. Even silly rituals, like daydreaming, can be helpful to relax if you spend a lot of time alone. If you had a happy childhood, you're more likely to be good at self-soothing. If your basic needs were met as a child, you viewed the world as a mostly safe, trustworthy place. However, if your needs were not met as a child, you feel insecure in the world. You may have a need to bring others into your space in order to soothe yourself. If your childhood was unstable, consider seeing a psychiatrist to talk through these rituals. It may be harder to be reclusive if you lack the ability to soothe yourself.\\n4. Spending time alone is scary for many people. In our modern era, we're more interconnected than ever. If you want to take some time to be reclusive, there will be an adjustment period. You may feel scared or confused when you first begin spending time alone. Try to push past any negative thoughts as you begin transitioning into spending more time alone. Remind yourself that you may feel some discomfort at first. However, also remember the benefits of alone time. You may be able to effectively work through certain problems or focus on certain creative pursuits if you give yourself time alone. These benefits are probably worth the initial adjustment period. If you feel very afraid at the notion of spending time alone, consider the root of this fear. Are you afraid of loneliness or is there something deeper at play. Bad past experiences can sometimes make a person hesitant to spend time alone. You may not want to let your thoughts wander to negative aspects of your past.\\n5. v4-460px-Be-a-Recluse-Step-2-Version-4.jpg\", 'question_id': 1034570, 'answer_choices': [[5, 3, 2, 4, 0, 1], [0, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5], [3, 4, 1, 2, 0, 5], [4, 5, 1, 0, 3, 2]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10345777.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Instead of using yogurt or ice cream, thicken your healthy smoothies with 1/2 to 1 tsp (1 to 2 1/2 g) of xanthan gum per 1 cup (240 mL) of liquid ingredients.

Sometimes there are ways to improve your job so that it goes from terrible or soul-sucking to much more manageable. This may mean having a talk with your boss, it could mean cutting down on your hours, and so on. For example: if it\\'s a coworker or your boss who is making your life miserable at work, you may want to have a private talk with them. They may not realize what they\\'re doing is affecting you so negatively. Even if they do realize, calling them on their behavior (especially if you can offer reasons why they need to change) can do a lot to improving things for you. Set boundaries.

If there is an unspoken rule that you have to work overtime, don\\'t fall into the trap.\\n5. With a job you hate, love, or are indifferent to, it can be difficult to remember the good portions of it and the reasons you have to be grateful for the job. Practicing gratitude about your job can make it easier to cope with it if you hate it, and remind you of all its excellent qualities when you are more positive towards it. Keep a gratitude journal that is only for your job. Every day come up with at least 3 things that you are grateful for about your job. This could be something like \"sun was coming through my work window\" or \"the cute delivery girl smiled at me\" or \"I got a raise today.\" Even if you aren\\'t feeling particularly grateful for your job that day, try to find just 3 things that you can focus on. try to come up with ways that this job is good for you.

Give yourself permission to have days where you simply don\\'t want to go to work, or don\\'t enjoy yourself there, even when you\\'re practicing gratitude and finding bright spots. The problem is when that is the only way you look at your job. Occasional down days and irritations are bound to crop up. When something happens that irritates or frustrates you, remind yourself that the specific situation is what is frustrating, not necessarily the job itself.

Trolling spoons are much lighter and smaller than their counterparts. A typical 3 in (7.6 cm) trolling spoon will only weigh ⁄8 ounce (3.5 g).

If it\\'s become normal in your family to lash out by raising your voice, it\\'s time that you work on changing that behavior for your entire family. Verbal and physical abuse can come in many forms and includes yelling, screaming, berating, hitting, slapping, or trying to humiliate someone. Instead of letting the argument escalate to that level, talk in a calm voice and get your opinions and views out without yelling or screaming. Instead of getting personal just say something like \"I really didn\\'t like that you went into my room and read my diary. Those are my personal thoughts and I want to keep them to myself.\" Older family members should set the example. The more that you yell and scream in your house, the more likely that children will emulate the behavior. If you are a younger person in the family whose elders yell and scream, it doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s the right thing to do. Remain calm and talk to your family members. Saying things like \"calm down\" or \"it\\'s not a big deal\" may make someone angrier. Try to see their point of view and the reasons they are mad instead of dismissing their feelings.\\n3. If you have negative thoughts about people in your family, and you build resentment towards them, it\\'s hard to break away from the mindset and consider all of the positive things that they do. Think of times in the past that they sacrificed to make you happier or times where you all enjoyed each other\\'s company instead of concentrating on the negative moments. If you\\'re a teenager, think about what your parents provide for you like food, clothing, shelter, love, and education opportunities. If you are a parent, think about the joy that you felt when you first had them and try to be more understanding. Another method you could use is to imagine how you would feel if you lost that family member that you have negative feelings for. This may make you appreciate them more.\\n4. Engaging in physical activity releases endorphins in your brain that make you happier. If you find yourself getting mad frequently, it may be because of a lack of physical activity.

A good job description will lay out everything that’s needed for the position, from soft skills to coding experience. For each requirement, come up with some examples of how you embody that trait or have used that skill. These will be your talking points for the interview. For example, if one of the bullet points is “strong leader,” jot down that time that you spearheaded the committee that implemented a new cybersecurity system. The list that you brainstorm is for your eyes only. You won’t bring it to the interview or memorize it, but it’s a good refresher to glance over right before you walk in. If there's a skill on the list that you don't possess, make a note of how you can improve that skill in case the interviewer asks you about it.

This is the most common, and seemingly the easiest, method for quitting smoking because it requires no outside aid. You simply stop smoking and commit yourself to being smoke-free. While those who quit abruptly are more successful than those who quit gradually, quitting without the use of nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) is rarely successful — only three to five percent of people who quit cold turkey stick with it. If you choose to go without NRT, the success of going cold turkey will depend entirely on your willpower. Those who are able to quit cold turkey may have a genetic advantage — 20 percent of people may have a genetic mutation that reduces the pleasurable effects of nicotine. To increase your chances of success when quitting cold turkey, try to take up new activities to replace smoking (particularly something that will occupy your hands or mouth, like knitting or chewing sugarless gum); avoid situations and people that you associate with smoking; call a friend or a quitting hotline (such as 1-800-QUIT-NOW); set goals and reward yourself. Consider having a backup strategy in case you are unable to go cold turkey. This is the easiest strategy to implement, but the most difficult to carry out successfully.\\n3. v4-460px-Stop-Smoking-Instantly-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n4. There are a number of different alternative practices that can help you quit smoking. These range from herbal and mineral supplements to hypnosis and practices like meditation. Although some smokers have found success using these methods, there is limited scientific evidence supporting them. Many smokers ingest Vitamin C candies and lozenges which they believe help curb their cravings. Meditation can be a useful practice to help distract your mind for the desire to smoke.\\n5. Your doctor can prescribe medications such as bupropion (Zyban, Wellbutrin) and varenicline (Chantix) that are designed to help curb your cravings. Talk with your physician about the side effects of these medications and whether they will work for you.

Sweat and dirt easily accumulate on a wig while you are wearing it.

You can wash your wig more frequently if you feel like it needs it, but excessively washing a wig can damage it over time. So use your best judgement on when to wash it.\\n2.

Once you are rewarding your dog for pulling on the towel or rope, you can move on to the final part of this subtask. Train your dog to pull harder and harder on the rope. Start holding off clicking and rewarding until he pulls so hard the door opens. Click and reward if the door even opens a little and closes again.

If you notice this is happening, stand in your dog\\'s way so that he will have to move in a direction that causes the door to open. Once he starts associating the door opening with a reward he will not need to be guided. Continue using the command throughout the process.

First, click and reward when he touches the towel or rope. Second, stop clicking and rewarding for just touching the rope. He will get aggravated and naturally bite the rope.

It's important to look closely at the carburetor and the oil compartment to make sure you're not tilting the mower in such a way as to spill oil all over the engine, the grass, and yourself. Generally, the safest way to do this is to tilt the mower back, toward the handle, and prop it with some kind of weight, or the help of a partner. This won't necessarily be true for all mowers, however, so use your judgment and consult the owner's manual, if necessary. It's also best to do this when there's no gas in the mower. Wait until you use it all up to change the blade, or you might consider draining out the gas with syphon hose. Typically, self-syphon pumps are sold at any hardware or automotive parts store. This prevents gas spillage onto the mower body.\\n2. Use a socket wrench of the appropriate size and unbolt the mounting, while using your other hand to keep the blade from turning. Be careful not to lose any washers or mounting hardware that hold the blade into place, which can be reused. Pay attention to the position of the blade as you're removing it. You'll mount the new one in the same orientation, usually with the sharp edge of the blade going counter-clockwise with the turning of the assembly. Again, this may not be true on all mowers, so pay attention to the way this blade is installed and install the new blade accordingly.\", 'question_id': 1035323, 'answer_choices': [[2, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 2], [1, 0, 2]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/103532.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

The process of removing quarter round trim has the potential to be damaging, so be aware of what condition you would like to leave the floors and baseboards in after removing the trim. Ripping the trim off the wall to quickly could cause the nails to leave larger holes behind in the floor or baseboard, and could also bend or even snap the trim in half. Not using your putty knife gently on the walls could leave scuff marks that may need to be re-touched with paint.

If the meals include multi-step preparations, such as marinating meat before cooking it, do these preparations at the start of the week and freeze or refrigerate the ingredients until it's time to cook.

A \"topic grab\" is when you find one of the things that the person mentions in a rant, and ask about it. This distracts them from their anger, and allows you to find something to connect with. If the person is raving about how hard their family life is and they mention a spouse and children, you could ask how old the children are, or how their spouse is doing.

If they don’t mention it, move on. But if they’re dealing with the same problem, they’ll likely continue the conversation. If you find you’re the only dealing with the issue, take a minute to make sure it really is an issue.

In some states (like Rhode Island, New York, and California), you cannot put cameras in places where people have a “reasonable expectation of privacy,” which includes bedrooms, bathrooms, and anywhere people get undressed.

Propane heaters are dangerous indoors because there's not enough oxygen available to dilute the carbon monoxide. Outside, propane heaters are very safe to use because of how much oxygen is available. You should only use the heater indoors in a large space with plenty of air and ventilation. Avoid using the propane heater in a small, enclosed space like a tent or a bedroom.\\n3. Generally, the bigger the propane heater, the more heat and carbon monoxide it'll make. Use the British Thermal Unit (BTU) measurement on the side of the propane heater to determine which size is best for you. BTUs measure energy. A single BTU is the same as the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 millilitre (0.034  fl oz) of water 1 °F (−17 °C). Small propane heaters can create up to 5000 BTUs in the space of an hour. These heaters are perfect for camping and other outdoor activities.

Taking the time to prepare healthy meals at home is often the best way to ensure a nutritious lunch. By carefully selecting ingredients at the grocery store, you can better count calories and avoid foods that you're intolerant or allergic to. A healthy lunch made at home might consist of brown rice (with vegetables) and grilled or baked chicken. (Brown rice offers extra dietary fiber and chicken is lean meat with lots of protein.) Home cooked leftovers can also be a healthier alternative to eating out, depending on the dish. Brown bag it: pack a sack lunch with a sandwich, cut vegetables like celery sticks, and a healthy treat like fruit flavored yogurt or fresh fruit. If you're pressed for time before work, bring a can of soup that can be heated up in a microwave safe container. Avoid varieties of soup that are high in sodium.\\n2. v4-460px-Build-Self%E2%80%90Control-Step-4.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Stop-Thinking-About-Sex-Step-12-Version-2.jpg\\n4. Sure, it puts some extra pep in your step. But like any drug, it is possible to overdose on caffeine, causing irritability, restlessness, and sleepless nights. None of those symptoms helps you be your best at work! Cap your caffeine consumption at 400 milligrams per day. That's the equivalent of 4 cups of brewed coffee, 10 cans of cola, or 2 energy shot drinks. Establish a caffeine schedule to distribute your consumption more evenly. For example, have an espresso in the morning, a cup of brewed coffee before lunch, and another in the afternoon. To help you sleep, set a time of day (like 4:00 pm) after which you won't drink caffeine. Tea can be a lower caffeine alternative to coffee, depending on the type of tea and the serving size. Counteract your daily coffee house fix with alternatives: orange juice, skim milk, water, and/or plain brewed coffee. Many caffeinated drinks like coffee, tea, and cola have low-caffeine or no-caffeine versions.\\n5. Calorie counting is not a diet, but a way to keep track of the amount of energy that comes from food and the amount of energy used by your body. There are several ways to count calories. Many fitness websites and apps have built-in calculators to help you. If daily calories from food total more than the daily number of calories you burn, you may be gaining weight. If daily calories from food total less than the daily number of calories you burn, you will probably lose weight.\", 'question_id': 1035582, 'answer_choices': [[5, 1, 2, 4, 3, 0], [1, 5, 2, 3, 4, 0], [5, 1, 0, 3, 4, 2], [5, 0, 4, 3, 1, 2]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10355831.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-459px-Store-Baklava-Step-4.jpg\\n1.

If you want a man to marry you, he has to trust you completely. In turn, if he\\'s the right man for you to marry, you should also feel that you\\'re able to trust him. That kind of trust requires being open and honest with each other. Don\\'t lie to him, and don\\'t tolerate dishonesty from him, either. Tip: If your gut tells you that you need to hide something, like meeting a friend for lunch, think about why you feel that way. If your guy might have a valid reason for objecting, like your friend has strong feelings for you, you might skip that lunch. If he has a habit of being unreasonable or controlling, or you feel like he\\'s trying to keep you apart from your friends, that could be indicative of abusive behavior.\\n1. Your values are things like your views on family, money, faith, and how you treat others.

Sometimes, marriage can work when you have opposing values, but it will take a lot more compromise and cooperation, and those issues may potentially be a source of conflict later on. For instance, if you believe it\\'s important to raise your children in church but your boyfriend hates organized religion, you may find yourself arguing about that if you have children together one day.\\n2. If you want your guy to feel like he can happily spend the rest of his life with you, take every opportunity you can to build him up. Frequently tell him how much you love him and how much he means to you, and give him specific compliments on the qualities and features you love most about him. For instance, you might say things like, \"You\\'re such a hard worker, and I really respect that about you,\" or \"I love your smile!\" If he\\'s feeling nervous about a job interview, you might say, \"You\\'re so smart and you\\'re more than qualified for the position. If they don\\'t choose you, they don\\'t deserve to have you!\"\\n3. Sometimes when you\\'re caught up in infatuation, it can be hard to slow down and recognize early warning signs. For instance, if he grabs you, pushes you, or screams at you during an argument, that type of behavior is likely to escalate in the future. Other red flags might include trying to keep you away from your family and friends, putting you down or making you feel bad about yourself, blaming you for his actions, or insisting that he take control of both of your finances.

Some recipes do call for you to peel the eggplant, and this may be a good idea if your eggplant is older or very large—the skin may be tough or bitter. Peel with a paring knife or a sharp vegetable peeler, and be prepared to cook the eggplant fairly soon after (the flesh will quickly discolor once peeled). If you've chosen a smaller, younger eggplant, then toughness and bitterness should not be a problem. The skin lends a heartiness to the dish as well as a pleasing color contrast.\\n2.

Leave the grill uncovered, and cook for about 8-10 minutes, turning occasionally until the center is soft and the skin is crisp. For a gas grill, preheat the grill and once hot, reduce the heat to medium. Place the eggplant slices directly on the grill, cover, and cook for 8-10 minutes, turning occasionally until the center is soft and the skin is crisp.

In the past, eggplants had a bit of bad reputation as being a bitter vegetable, but most varieties available now have been bred to be much more mild.

To level the ground for a shed, you'll need plenty of different materials, all of which you can buy at the local hardware store.

Putting a shed on a hill or another slanted area is a very difficult process that might require heavy machinery. You will find it much easier to level a relatively flat area.

Hiding your feelings may result in tension and a sense of disconnectedness in your relationship. Be sure to express this in an open and non-confrontational way. For instance, you can say, \"I\\'ve been feeling jealous about your night out this weekend but I am trying to keep my emotions in check.\" If this revelation makes your boyfriend angry, ask him why he is reacting that way and suggest that you have a serious conversation about it. If your boyfriend suggests that your jealousy is irrational, ask him how he might feel if he were in your shoes.\\n2. v4-460px-Deal-with-Your-Boyfriend-Going-Out-Step-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10357503, 'answer_choices': [[1, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2], [0, 2, 1]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10357553.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. In most cars, the MAP sensor is right next to the intake manifold. It should be attached to an electrical connector that is fastened to a group of wires. There will also be a rubber vacuum hose running to it. If you're having trouble finding it, lift the engine's wiring harness slightly to give yourself a better view. Loosen the wiring harness by pulling out the plastic ends attached to its wires.

Use a socket wrench to turn them counterclockwise and remove them from the vehicle. Afterward, your sensor should come loose. Keep the bolts in a small plastic container so they don't get lost.\\n3. Before working on your car, you need to disconnect the battery while the engine is off. Find a flat surface to park your car and let the engine cool for about 5 minutes.

For some men, emotional walls are products of a lifetime of social expectations that men should be physically and mentally strong. For others, certain life events may have caused him to put up walls. Consider what you know about the man you’re dealing with and think about why he might be emotionally unavailable. Remember, his lack of emotional expression does not mean that he does not love or care for you. Talk to him to better understand why he may put up walls. Common life events that can trigger emotional walls include previous relationships gone bad, unhealthy relationships with their parents, struggles with addiction, or a sense of failure at work or school. Understanding why a man is emotionally unavailable can help you target your approach for dealing with him. Men who are socialized to be unavailable may desire an emotional outlet that they just don’t know how to access. Men who are unavailable due to past pain are often trying not to get hurt again. Do some research on different styles of attachment and how different life experiences may impact someone's emotional availability.\\n1. An emotionally unavailable person can change, but that change has to come from within. You can say and do all the right things, and your man may still not decide that he wants to open up emotionally. He needs to decide that he wants to change for himself, and it’s not your job to guide him to that conclusion. If he does decide he wants to make a substantial life change, support him and offer words of encouragement. Just don’t expect those to be what initiates his desire to change. Remember, not all men will want to learn how to express their emotions in a way that conforms with your standards or expectations. Some may have even grown up in cultures or households that could prevent them from making this kind of serious mental change.\\n2. v4-460px-Know-if-He%27s-Husband-Material-Step-9.jpg\", 'question_id': 10357800, 'answer_choices': [[1, 2, 0], [0, 2, 1], [0, 2, 1], [0, 2, 1]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10357932.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Apply-Vinyl-Wrap-Step-4.jpg\\n1. Spray a cleaning solution directly onto the surface you’re wrapping, and use a lint-free cloth to buff the surface. Move the cloth in counter-clockwise circles until the surface is completely dry. Dirt and moisture will keep the adhesive from sticking properly. Rapid Tac is an excellent solution for cleaning surfaces before wrapping them. Try not to place the vinyl film on the floor, because it will attract dirt particles. These dirt particles will leave scratches once you start to apply it. If you are wrapping a truck or car, take it through a car wash 24 hours ahead of time so it can dry overnight. Do not use waxes or protectants, as they could interfere with the adhesive.\\n2. v4-460px-Apply-Vinyl-Wrap-Step-2.jpg\\n3. The two main types of vinyl are calendared and cast. Calendared vinyl is thicker but stickier, while cast vinyl is more flexible and easier to manipulate around curves and edges. Choose vinyl with built-in air release channels for a smooth installation. Use vinyl wrap on smooth substrates like glass, corrugated plastic, and painted aluminum. Avoid using vinyl on wooden surfaces. Purchase roughly 15–20 feet (4.6–6.1 m) more vinyl than you think you’ll need in case you mess up any of the panels. Avoid using chrome is this is your first time applying vinyl wrap. Chrome is the most expensive and most difficult to apply, especially for beginners. Printed and gloss covers have a longer lifespan and offer better protection than matte vinyl.\\n4. Repeat the same process as before, but this time, measure the width. Use a roll of painter’s tape and place it roughly in the center on the long edge of the surface. Leaving at least 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) hanging off of each side, roll the tape directly across the length-wise tape and stick it down.

Your upstairs neighbors have the right to enjoy their residence just as much as you do, and the fact that you can hear them might not be their fault. Living in a multi-unit building means you may have to accept a certain amount of noise during normal daytime hours. Uninsulated or improperly-installed floors can actually magnify sounds, making everyday sounds like walking, cooking, or talking seem much louder to you. Heavy foot traffic around dinnertime is one thing, but late-night parties on a weeknight are another.\\n2. The best way to handle the problem is with a personal conversation, but if you’re not sure that will go well, send your neighbor a short, friendly note. Try to keep it to about 4-5 sentences, be specific about the type of noise that’s bothering you, and be sure to avoid sarcasm, threats, or passive-aggressive language. Make a copy of the letter, and date it, in case the problem continues. Your note could say something along the lines of, “Hi #212! I live below you, and I was wondering if you’d mind waiting to run on the treadmill until after 6:30 a.m.? It sounds like it’s right above my bedroom, and the noise wakes me up. I hope that’s not an inconvenience! Thanks!”\\n3. Don't approach them in the middle of a party or late at night, when tempers may be more likely to flare. Also, don’t try to talk to them when you’re angry, if you can help it. Instead, plan to have a calm conversation first thing in the morning, or you can wait until around dinner time if you or your neighbors are night owls.\\n4. v4-460px-Deal-with-Noisy-Upstairs-Neighbors-Step-2.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Deal-with-Noisy-Upstairs-Neighbors-Step-6.jpg\", 'question_id': 10357938, 'answer_choices': [[1, 4, 3, 0, 2, 5], [5, 2, 1, 4, 3, 0], [1, 5, 4, 2, 0, 3], [1, 5, 3, 0, 2, 4]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10358007.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. A pecan pie that will be used the same day as it was baked, or even the next day, can safely be left at room temperature. Just keep it covered and place in an out of the way place on your counter. Store bought pies are likely to contain preservatives, so consult the packaging to determine if it can be kept at room temperature or if it needs to be refrigerated. The amount of sugar in a pecan pie will make it very difficult for it to spoil quickly. However, if you are nervous about spoilage, err on the side of caution and choose to refrigerate the pie.\\n1. If you have cooked a pecan pie yourself, it’s important to let it cool before covering it and storing it. Make sure it is room temperature by touching the underside of the pan. If there is any heat given off, it needs to cool longer. In most cases, it will take several hours for a freshly baked pie to cool to room temperature. If you have baked the pie late in the day, you will likely need to let it cool at room temperature overnight before refrigerating it. Having your pie be completely cool will help ensure that it is set when you store it. A set pie will hold up better to the jostling and movement you will put it through while storing it.\\n2. A pecan pie that is stored in a refrigerator can be kept fresh for 3 to 4 days. Simply take the pie out of the fridge and let it come to room temperature or heat it up before serving. If you want to reheat the pie, try putting it in a 275 °F (135 °C) oven for 15 minutes before serving it. You can usually tell that a pie has gone bad by inspecting the crust. If it looks soggy or moldy, the pie has gone bad and you need to dispose of it.\\n3. v4-459px-Store-Pecan-Pie-Step-4.jpg\\n4. v4-459px-Store-Pecan-Pie-Step-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10358007, 'answer_choices': [[3, 1, 0, 2, 4], [0, 1, 4, 3, 2], [1, 0, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4, 0, 3, 2]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10358013.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Cite-an-Annual-Report-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Cite-an-Annual-Report-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n2.

If you are trying to get from one room to another and a hissing, snarling cat blocks the way, look at the situation from his viewpoint. The cat believes he is trapped and you are walking towards him, which he perceives as a threat. He wants to run but there is no escape route so he must defend himself by attacking. The simple solution is to step aside, let the cat pass (which he will do at speed) and then go about your way. Don\\'t feed your cat for 20 minutes following a biting or scratching incident, as this might be wrongly taken as a reward.\\n1. The moment your cat stops biting or scratching you, stand up and walk away in a dismissive fashion without any further interaction. Make sure that the cat is all alone in the room with no human interaction for 5 to 10 minutes. Repeat this each time he tries to bite or scratch you. He will quickly associate the bad behavior with being ignored. This method won\\'t work with all cats, but works well with very affectionate cats, since they\\'ll miss the attention, and with kittens, since they\\'re still learning manners.\\n2.

As soon as the cat bites or scratches, say \"NO!\" in an authoritative tone. At the same time, point your finger at the cat. Stare at the cat directly with an unimpressed or fierce look. Stares are regarded in the cat world as a threat of dominance.

If you have some short stories or essays that you think are ready to be sent out into the world, then you should try your hand at submitting them to literary journals or journals that publish work in your genre, such as journals that specialize in historical fiction or romance. Check out duotrope.com to get an idea of all of the journals out there. All you have to do is get your manuscript in order and send a brief cover letter to the editor of the journal; after that, you play the waiting game. This will be your first exposure to something common to the writer: lots of rejection. Try not to take it personally and consider it a way of thickening your skin. Some journals charge a $2-3 fee for submitting your work. This is a pain, but it doesn't mean the journals are trying to rob you; they are often run on a shoestring budget.\\n1. v4-460px-1035918-2.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-1035918-4.jpg\\n3. If you want to publish a work of literary fiction or non-fiction, then getting an M.A. or M.F.A. in Fiction or Non-Fiction is the typical route to follow. If you want to write something more commercial, such as a science fiction or romance novel, then this route is less necessary, though it can still be helpful. Getting a degree in creative writing can initiate you into the life of a writer, get you in a community of other like-minded writers who give helpful feedback, and will also give you two or three years to focus on your craft. Many successful writers who publish their books find work as teachers at M.F.A. or undergraduate writing programs. You'll need a degree in creative writing to do this, so if this is your end game, consider getting the degree. Getting a degree in creative writing can also help you get your foot in the door in terms of connections. You'll meet faculty members that may be able to help you publish your work or develop as a writer in other ways. The writing degree it not a direct path to success as a writer. But it can help you improve your craft significantly.\\n4. This may not be what you want to hear when you want to hear about the exciting life of being an author, but reading will be the key to your success. Reading everything you can will not only help you develop your writing skills, give you more ideas for how to craft your work, and help you develop the patience you need to write a book of your own, but it will also give you a better sense of what is selling in the market. Set aside a few hours a day to read as many books as you can, and try to read widely in as many genres as you can. If you already have an idea of what genre you want to write in, whether it's science fiction or non-fiction, you should focus on reading books in that genre. However, to become more well read in general, you should read widely when you can. The more you read, the more you'll become attuned to common clichés. You want your book to stand out, so if you find ten books that are too much like it, you may have to find a different angle. When you find a book you really like, ask yourself what it is that makes it so special to you. Is it the ridiculous main character? The beautiful prose? The sense of place? The more you can pinpoint why you like a book, the sharper you'll be when you try to make your own work appeal to a wide audience.\", 'question_id': 1035918, 'answer_choices': [[3, 1, 2, 4, 0], [3, 4, 2, 1, 0], [3, 0, 2, 4, 1], [4, 1, 3, 2, 0]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10359897.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Not only does physical activity boost the endorphins in your brain, putting you in a better mood, it also gets rid of tension and lowers stress. Plus, when you’re focusing on putting one foot in front of the other or counting reps, you aren’t thinking about work. Win-win. Challenging workouts or workouts that incorporate intervals require you to really focus on what you’re doing. Something like a boxing circuit workout or a Zumba class provides a better distraction than a long run where you’re left alone with your thoughts. If you don’t have time for 30 minutes of exercise all at once, break it up into smaller chunks. Take 3 10-minute walks or do 5 minutes of push ups and sit ups 6 times throughout the day.\\n1. v4-460px-Stop-Thinking-About-Work-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Stop-Thinking-About-Work-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\\n3. The more activities you have scheduled after hours, the less time there is for your mind to wander back to work issues. At the start of each week, plan how you’ll spend your evenings, from going to happy hour with friends to running errands. Do the same for the upcoming weekend on Thursday or Friday. Map out your week in a planner or use a calendar app on your phone. Don’t just fill your schedule with social events. Having some downtime to relax is equally important. But come up with ways to spend that time, too, like reading a book or playing with your dog.\\n4. Leave your work computer and phone at home, plan activities that will keep you busy during your break, and focus on enjoying the sights and the people you’re with. Make sure to tie up any loose ends and prepare a plan for coverage at work before you leave so you aren’t worrying while you’re away. Don’t forget to set an out of office email since you won’t (or shouldn’t) be checking your inbox. You don't have to spend a lot of money or go somewhere far away. Even a “staycation” where you take a few days off to yourself at home can help you reset. Spend a couple of weeks planning your getaway to shift your focus off work. Read travel books, look at pictures of wherever you’re going on Instagram, and drafting an itinerary are enough to keep your brain busy. A sample out of office email looks like: “Thank you for your email. I’m out of the office starting August 17th and won’t return until August 24th.

Lay the stems lengthwise along a sheet of plastic wrap. Roll the chives up in the plastic wrap similar to how you would roll a burrito.

The first step in combating pet obesity is to make sure your pet is not suffering from a medical illness that either contributes to obesity or is a complication from being overweight. In dogs and rarely in cats, hypothyroidism, or low thyroid hormone levels, can cause a pet to gain weight. Hypothyroidism can also cause a dog’s hair to thin or fall out in patches. The dog may also become less playful and energetic. Increased secretion of hormones from the adrenal glands or from an insulin secreting tumor can also cause obesity. But by far the most common cause of obesity is eating too much food without an increase in exercise to compensate.\\n3. Diabetes is a severe consequence of obesity in pets just as with humans. An animal with diabetes can lose weight rapidly, urinate more frequency and in larger volumes, have an increase in thirst, and be more susceptible to infections, especially urinary tract infections. Extra body weight can also stress the bones and joints in the body, leading to arthritis. It can also harm internal organs leading to a decrease in lifespan for the overweight pet. Being underweight can make a pet more susceptible to infectious illnesses. Young animals that are underweight due to parasites can have intestinal problems well into adulthood and after the parasites are destroyed.', 'question_id': 103605, 'answer_choices': [[1, 2, 3, 0], [3, 2, 0, 1], [2, 0, 3, 1], [0, 1, 2, 3]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10360674.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Fix-Faux-Leather-Peeling-Step-4.jpg\\n1. To see if the thick goo is dry, tap it with a finger. If your finger comes away clean and the goo doesn’t feel wet, it’s most likely fully dry. If your finger comes away with some goo on it, give the goo another 12 hours to dry. After the shoes are dry, you can start wearing them as soon as you like.\\n2. Before you begin any kind of repair job, you’ll first need to get all of the flaking, peeling faux leather off of the shoes. Sand the top and sides of the shoes wherever you note flakes. Sand in tight circles and be sure to apply plenty of pressure to the shoe. You can purchase sandpaper at any hardware store. Pick up at least 4 sheets for this project.\\n3. v4-460px-Fix-Faux-Leather-Peeling-Step-2.jpg\\n4. Dip a rag into a tin of shoe polish and smear it across the surface of the sanded shoe. Work in long, even strokes across the top and sides of the shoes. Be sure to apply the shoe polish evenly, so that the shoes have a uniform color across all surfaces.

You’ll want to ensure that your colorant is completely mixed into your resin and that the new color is applied throughout the mixture. Stir the resin until your resin is smooth and without air bubbles to ensure a smooth finish when applied.\\n1. Once you’ve achieved the results you wanted in the small mixing container, you can now repeat the process to safely color the rest of your resin. Make sure you use the same proportion of colorant as you did with the 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) mixture. For example, if you used .25 fluid ounces (7.4 mL) of resin in your mixing cup to test the colorant and your overall amount of resin is 2 fluid ounces (59 mL), then you should multiply the amount of colorant you added to the mixing cup by 8 to determine the amount you should use in the rest of the resin.\\n2. Before adding your colorant to all of your resin, you’ll want to test it with a small amount of resin to make sure it produces a color that you like. Use a mixing container that includes volume measurements on the side for easier measuring. For example, a small measuring cup used for dispensing cough syrup would work very well for testing resin colorants.\\n3. v4-460px-Color-Epoxy-Resin-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Color-Epoxy-Resin-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Color-Epoxy-Resin-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n6. While there are plenty of paints, inks, and tints available on the market, most are not specifically intended to be used to color resin. For best results, purchase a paint or tint designed to bond with resin and bring out particularly saturated colors. A tint is an artificial dye used to change an object’s color.

Face your partner, pucker your mouth a little and plant a kiss on your partner’s lips. Don’t open your mouth until after your lips are already touching! Rest one hand on your lap or to the side and gently touch your partner on their cheek or hair with the other. Follow your partner’s lead. If they’re keeping things light and slow, it’s best to do the same. Don’t try to push to go too fast — savor the moment, and continually try to read your partner’s body language to make sure they’re feeling comfortable and relaxed. Also, remember that you can stop anytime you want, even if you\\'re the one who initiated the kiss.

Some people think it’s polite to ask verbally, and your partner might appreciate you being direct. Tell your partner that you’re interested in them, or that you had a nice time with them, and then ask, “would you be comfortable with a kiss?” or “is it okay if I kiss you?” \\nDon’t try to kiss someone out of the blue, with no warning — you should try to build towards the moment gradually.\\n5. Start by joking around or gently flirting with your partner, in order to build the mood. Hinting at your interest in them gives them a chance to respond in kind if they reciprocate your feelings, and helps you gauge their interest in kissing you. Make eye contact with your partner whenever the car comes to a stop, and once you park turn your whole body towards them to show you’re listening and interested. Ask your partner questions. Everyone likes to talk about themselves, and trying to learn more about your partner’s life, hobbies, or thoughts signals that you’re interested. Try telling your partner something positive about themselves or about the time you just shared together, such as \"I really had a good time with you tonight, and I\\'d be interested in hanging out with you again!\" If they respond positively and echo your feelings - for example, if they tell you that they want to meet up again - this may be a good sign that they’re on the same page.\\n6. Initiating physical touch with your partner helps remove barriers between the two of you, allows you to gauge their interest, and may help both of you feel more comfortable. Keep things non-sexual to make sure your touch is not coming across as creepy and unwelcome. Examples of light, non-sexual touch include tapping your partner on the shoulder to get their attention, touching their arm while you’re talking to them, or placing your hand right next to theirs.

Massaging your head encourages blood flow, which can help your hair grow back more quickly. Run your hands over your head from front to back, pressing down gently, then press in the tips of your fingers and run them in small circles on the top of your scalp. Repeat on the back and sides of your head. Do this once a day to give your hair a boost. You can also use a hydrating oil, such as coconut oil, to increase scalp health. Pour a bit on your head and use your fingers to massage it over your scalp. Give your head a short massage when you’re washing your hair as well. You can also use a head massager to massage your scalp.\\n3. Hydrating shampoos won’t strip natural oils from your hair, which keeps your scalp healthy and your follicles strong. Apply a coin-sized amount to your wet hair when you’re in the shower. Once you rinse out the shampoo, apply a bit of conditioner and rinse it out with cool water to seal your cuticle and protect the proteins in your hair. It’s best not wash your hair too frequently when you’re growing it out, as frequent washes can strip out natural oils and slow down hair growth. Hair doesn't need to be shampooed daily. If you can try washing it twice a week. If not, at least try washing it every other day. Once your hair starts to grow out, use a bit more shampoo and conditioner. Focus on applying the shampoo close to your scalp and keeping the conditioner near the tips of your hair, when they grow longer.\\n4. v4-460px-Grow-Out-a-Buzzcut-Step-4.jpeg\\n5. Eating healthy will give your hair the nutrients it needs to grow long and strong.

Use a seed drill attached to a lawnmower or tractor to space your seeds evenly and cover them with soil. Pour the seeds into the hopper and let the machine do the work for you. The machine will also bury the seeds to the correct depth so birds and pests can’t get to them. Keep the seeds closer together if you want to grow hemp for fibers since this will make them grow up rather than branch out. Spread the seeds further apart if you want to harvest seeds. This encourages the plants to branch out and grow shorter. Clean the machine after you use it. Ask local farm machinery stores to see if they have seed drills available to buy or rent.\\n2.

Healthy clams should be either closed tightly or slightly open. If they’re open, they should shut quickly when you tap on them. If any clams are open and do not shut when you tap on them, or if they float in water, they are dead and should be discarded immediately. Also, if you see any broken or damaged shells, throw those clams out right away. It’s important to throw out dead clams right away so they don’t contaminate those that are still alive. The clams should have a fresh smell that reminds you of the ocean. If the clams smell fishy or they have an ammonia-like smell, throw them out. Soft-shell clams have a long neck, so they may not close completely.\\n3. A damp towel will keep the clams from drying out, but it will also allow them to get fresh air. Don't cover them in plastic or they'll smother. If you like, you can use damp paper towels instead of a cloth towel.\\n4. When it comes to eating shellfish, the sooner you can prepare them, the better. In the case of clams, make sure you eat them within 3 days at the most. If it’s going to be longer than that, freeze the clams rather than keeping them in the refrigerator. Check the clams every day for any open shells and remove them promptly.

If you\\'ve answered the above questions to your satisfaction, consider washing by hand. Machine washing is really only suitable for very strong quilts (or those cheap ones made in China that you intend to only hang on to for a short time). The bathtub is the best place as it\\'s big and there\\'s plenty of room to maneuver. Ideally, you will need a helper to wash and lift the wet quilt. Fill the bath about 8 inches/20cm with lukewarm/tepid water. (If your local water is hard, consider using distilled water or rainwater from the tank, heated in a kettle or saucepan.) Lower a large sheet into the bath first. This acts as a \"sling\" for the quilt. Gently lower the quilt onto the sheet. Press gently across the quilt. Swish the water around gently, but not the quilt; keep it steady. If using a detergent, make sure it is suitable for the quilt. Ask at a local quilt retailer or society for advice on a suitable detergent. A wool wash will usually be okay if you can\\'t find a specialized detergent but dilute it before adding it to the bathwater. Drain the water, taking care to keep the quilt away from the drain suction. Refill with lukewarm water for a rinse cycle. Gently agitate, drain again. Do this about 4 to 6 times until you feel the quilt has been cleaned adequately and the detergent is off the quilt. Drain one last time. Pat the quilt with large dry and clean towels. These will start to absorb leftover water from the quilt. Lift the quilt out of the bath by holding the corners of the sheet it is sitting on. Carry it outside to dry (see Airing above, although you may wish to substitute a blanket for a sheet on the ground). This really needs to be done with a helper, to prevent a mishap (and wet quilts tend to be heavy). When drying, place right side down to keep this as clean as possible. Allow to dry completely. It should not be stored until it is completely dry, to avoid the possibility of mildew growth.\\n2. v4-460px-Store-a-Quilt-Step-6.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Store-a-Quilt-Step-4.jpg\\n4. If the only noticeable problem with the quilt is that it smells musty or unpleasant, airing might be the answer. To air the quilt:\\nWait for a dry day without too much wind. Find a suitable shady spot outside. The spot should be fairly clean, such as concrete, nice grass or fresh new leaves, etc. Don\\'t choose a spot where there is a lot of dust liable to blow over the quilt. Throw a large cotton sheet across the ground. This will keep the quilt separate from the surface, preventing any potential stains. Lay the quilt over the sheet, taking care not to overlap at the edges. Alternatively, a quilt that is in good, strong condition can be laid over a clothesline. If so, throw the base sheet over several of the lines of the clothesline (as if you were laying the table), then drape the quilt across the sheet, over the several lines. This method will probably use up all of the clothesline, so avoid doing it on a usual washing day. Avoid pinning the quilt to the clothesline as usually done for drying clothing, as this will stretch the stitches and fibers too much.\\n5. Any food scraps or stains need to be removed prior to storage as these tend to attract insects as their own food source. Also remove dirt, smudges and any other source of stains. The safest method for cleaning a quilt is vacuuming, followed by airing, then washing. Each approach is discussed in the following steps.\\n6. These aren\\'t just old, they\\'re usually very delicate and they\\'ve suffered their fair share of wear and tear. The fibers and colors of such quilts are likely to have been exposed to light, moisture and acidic conditions over time and hence will have weakened.

For ordinary stings that don’t cause an allergic reaction (see below), home treatment after applying initial first aid is adequate. In most cases, the signs and symptoms associated with the sting should disappear within several hours or a day or two. There are, however, some home remedies that can provide relief from the sting of the sting, so to speak. These include:\\nMake a paste of baking soda and water to place over the area. The baking soda helps to soothe the area, reduce the swelling and calm any itching. Apply honey to the area to reduce the swelling and discomfort. Honey has natural antibacterial properties. Crush a couple of cloves of garlic and apply the juice to the area. Garlic also has natural antibacterial properties. Lavender essential oil can help reduce the pain of bee and wasp stings when a couple of drops are applied topically to the affected area.\\n4. Wash the sting site gently with soap and water. Use cool water to help reduce the discomfort. Hot/warm water will increase the circulation to the area and increase the swelling. Then, apply a cold pack or ice to reduce swelling. If you are using ice, ensure that there is a towel between the ice and your skin to reduce the potential for cold damage to the skin's surface. Apply the cold pack or ice for 20 minutes once an hour until you feel relief. If the area is very itchy, you could take an oral antihistamine like Benadryl to relieve the itching. Alternatively, over-the-counter topical corticosteroid cream can also be used to reduce the histamine response in the area to the sting. If you feel pain in the area, you can take ibuprofen (Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) as needed. Follow all dosing instructions on the bottle.\\n5. If you have had multiple stings in the past or this instance has multiple stings, you may experience an allergic reaction to the protein in the venom of the wasp or bee. The level of your reaction will determine whether further treatment or professional medical assistance is required. A mild reaction will be localized to the area where you were stung. You may develop a red, raised welt that is approximately ½ inch in diameter. However, some people will experience a red raised area up to two inches in diameter. The area may be itchy. The center is often white where the stinger punctured the skin. A moderate reaction includes the localized response you’ll see in a mild reaction, with the addition of swelling of the affected area that extends beyond two inches in the day or two following the sting. Moderate reactions usually peak at 48 hours and last five to ten days. A severe reaction to a sting those symptoms in the mild and moderate levels of reaction with chronic hives (urticaria), diarrhea, coughing or difficulty breathing, swelling of the tongue and throat, weak and rapid pulse, reduced blood pressure, loss of consciousness and, potentially, death if not treated quickly. If you experience any of these symptoms, you should call your local emergency number. If you are aware of your allergy and have an epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen, Auvi-Q or other), you should use it or have someone nearby use it on you.

Mounting your TV above a built-in fixture in your home such as your mantel helps take the focus off the TV when it’s not in use. This creates a balanced look in your room and lets the TV act as an accent over the fireplace rather than being the sole focus of a wall. Consider speaking with an electrician or a handyman about concealing your cables in your wall when you mount the TV. Hanging cables can be dangerous if left too close to your fireplace when it’s in use. Before you install your TV over the fire place, make sure you can comfortably watch it at the height. If your fireplace is very high, it may be painful to crane your neck while watching it.\\n1. While the base of your TV may be small enough to fit on a tiny stand, look for a stand that’s wider than your TV screen. A wider TV stand will help balance your screen and make your TV placement look more intentional. Too small a stand can make your TV look precarious and make your room feel empty. This means if you have a 42 in (110 cm) TV, you want at least a 46 in (120 cm) stand, even if base for your TV is 15 in (38 cm). Check that your stand doesn't look wobbly or narrow. If it is, the stand might look too small once your TV is in place.\\n2. Bookcases work great sitting on either side of a mounted TV or a TV stand. Find a pair of matching bookshelves to frame your TV, show off decorative pieces, and use your books as smart and chic décor when you’re not reading them. Make sure your bookcases are evenly spaced on either side of your TV to keep the area looking symmetrical. This helps distract from the TV itself.

It’s important that you measure as specifically as possible—to the nearest 1/16 of an inch—so that the cut molding will fit perfectly. If you need to round your measurement, round up. Measure all 4 walls if you’re redoing a room or repairing a bad molding job. If the wall you’re measuring is longer than your tape measure, just measure from 1 side of the wall as far as your tape measure will go. For example, say it’s 100 inches (250 cm).

Pants underneath a long tunic dress are warmer than tights and more comfortable, making your outfit winter appropriate. Wear tight pants that are of a neutral color such as black leather pants or skinny jeans. This is a great example of an intriguing layering.

Look for tight-fitting T-shirts in a color that complements the dress, like a cap sleeve tee under a jumper or a stretchy tank top under a V-neck dress.\\n1. Wear the thin version of a wool turtleneck underneath a long strappy dress or a V-neck short-sleeve skater dress. For a more conservative approach to layering, you can choose to work with one neutral color for both items such as gray, beige, or black, or you can opt for a bolder fashion statement by mixing up colors. Regardless of the color coordination, the mixture of different fabrics and textures will make the layering effect noticeable. To avoid a bulky look, wear a thin turtleneck and a thicker or voluminous dress. Keep your hair up to showcase your turtleneck and accessorize your look with a pair of dangling chandelier earrings. Alternatively, you can compliment your outfit by attaching a brooch to your turtleneck. It can be a metal, blingy pin or an eccentric fabric, wooden, or ceramic one.\\n2. v4-460px-Layer-a-Dress-Step-2.jpg\\n3. Depending on how you combine lace tights, you can give them a different look: sophisticated, elegant, romantic, or edgy. Wear them below a casual dress for a multidimensional style. Avoid wearing lace tights with a dress covered in patterns, as it will end up being a battle for supremacy. Instead, opt for a monochromatic dress, which can be matched with a necklace of a different color. If you want to showcase a brighter and funnier side of you, opt for color tights. Wear a pair of pink or yellow tights for a twist on a total black look, or dare to play with many colors at once by wearing a patterned dress. For a well-balanced look, add an accessory such as a crossbody handbag, which matches the color of the tights.\\n4. v4-460px-Layer-a-Dress-Step-4.jpg', 'question_id': 10372074, 'answer_choices': [[2, 0, 3, 4, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 0], [0, 4, 3, 2, 1], [3, 4, 2, 1, 0]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/103722.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Write-a-Book-As-a-Teenager-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\\n1.

Turn your life stories into fiction using your imagination! Change the names of everyone involved, and add a few exciting incidents that didn’t really happen.

I'd encourage them to start with short stories, especially flash fiction is between 1500-2000 words. You can find lots of opportunities to publish flash fiction, whether it's online, in magazines, and in websites. You can even enter your stories in competitions where you could win prizes, get published in newspapers, or be included in an anthology.\\n2. You might insert your main character into an event that actually happened. Alternatively, you could just write about a character than lives in a time period you think is interesting. Think about historical events or periods you liked learning about in history class. Do some research about the period. For example, you might write a book that takes place in Ancient Egypt. You can create a realistic story set in a different time period, or you can use history to inspire a fantasy story.\\n3. v4-460px-Write-a-Book-As-a-Teenager-Step-6-Version-3.jpg\\n4. Writing classes can help you learn more techniques for developing story ideas. In many cases, you'll learn about different templates that can help you with brainstorming. You'll also have the benefit of bouncing ideas off fellow writers. Look for a creative writing class at your school. You may also be able to find 1 at your local library or community center.

Cables should be small so as not to cause a trip hazard, and should be non-flammable. Be sure to double check your building’s safety and fire codes before installing cables.

You may even want to make a sketch of the room before beginning to help you visualize the best spot to place the cable. Consider running your cable along a wall where it will be inconspicuous.

Squash like warm conditions with soil that is fertile, well-drained, and has a pH of 6 to 6.5 To get good growth and production, you\\'ll need to add lots of organic matter to your garden.

Here are a few basics to consider:\\n\\nButternut squash. This type of squash is bottle-shaped with a light brown rind. It is one of the most popular, common, and arguably most delicious. This type has a rich flavor and a smooth texture, in addition to a natural resistance to squash vine borers. They will store for six months or longer. Buttercup squash. This type isn\\'t too different from the butternut squash, but it does mature faster than butternut or hubbard. It is good for areas with a shorter, cooler growing season. Each plant will likely grow vigorously and produce heavy crops of squat, green fruits. This type stores for four to six months. Hubbard squash and kabocha squash. These two types are often clumped together due to their similarities. They can be medium-sized or they can be absolutely huge. In general, they have drier flesh than most other winter squash. Their color varies by variety, and all varieties will store for four to six months. Delicata squash and dumpling squash. Delicate squash are cylinder-shaped and dumpling squash are pumpkin-shaped. They both produce single-serving-size, ivory-colored fruits with green stripes that turn orange when stored. If you live in a cool climate, these are pretty easy to grow. They are fast to mature and will store for three to five months. Acorn squash. This type is a ribbed, round fruit with a gold or green rinds. They also mature quickly and will store for at least three months. They are them popular in areas with short summers as there maturation process doesn\\'t take much time. Spaghetti squash.

There are times when it is helpful to ask others for their opinions. You may not always recognize how you are behaving, so getting input from trusted friends or family can be helpful. They may notice that you get extremely quiet around certain people, or freeze and shut down in certain situations. Not everyone is able to give constructive feedback, so think about a friend or family member that can be honest with you without being abusive, dismissive, or demeaning. Ask that person if they notice that you demonstrate any insecurities. Request that they be completely honest. You might feel vulnerable when asking others for input about you as a person, but your goal is to learn more about yourself so you can lessen your insecurities. An example of good feedback would be something like: \"You seem really concerned with fitting in with people you think are cool, and when they\\'re around you get really loud and out of control. I think you are great and have a lot to offer others, and you could work on building your self-confidence.\" An example of destructive feedback would be: \"You\\'re a total weirdo and a slob.\"\\n2. v4-460px-Recognize-Insecurities-Step-4-Version-5.jpg\\n3.

Focusing on your self-determined negative qualities will keep you in a state of insecurity. Harshly judging yourself does no good for anyone. Avoid harshly judging yourself because it produces an unfair representation of you. Picking on yourself is detrimental to your mood, motivation and outlook on life. Look in the mirror each morning and tell yourself three things you like about yourself. The more you point out the positive, the more likely it is that you will build confidence and hush your insecure self-talk.

It's not just the hair on your head that needs washing -- your pubic hair needs a little love and attention too.

Take a trip to the casino during the daytime and take a look around when you won’t be distracted by the hustle and bustle of nighttime gambling. An added bonus of visiting when it’s less busy—you may be able to play a game while a dealer gives you a breakdown of the technical aspects.\\n3. The longer you stay at a casino, the higher the chances are that you’ll lose money—the odds are always in the house’s favor! So set a time limit for several hours, and after that time, call it quits.

The more milk you can remove from your breasts, the more you will produce. To encourage your body to produce as much milk as possible, pump or breastfeed about every 2-3 hours, which works out to about 8-12 times a day. Try to pump for at least 15-20 minutes at a time. Even if you’re working full-time, try to pump on your lunch hour and other breaks.\\n1. Every woman’s breast size and shape is different, so it’s important to find the flanges, or the cups that attach to your pump, that fit you correctly. If the flanges don’t form a seal around your breast, the pump won’t be able to extract as much milk. If you notice a gap, or if the flange seems too tight, call your breast pump manufacturer to order new flanges. If your nipple looks squashed inside of the flange, you probably need a bigger size. If a large amount of your breast is being pulled into the flange, you likely need a smaller size. The flange sizes can vary depending on the make and model of your pump.

Because frogs come up to the surface for air, they don’t absolutely need an aerator, but installing one will keep your tank water healthy by encouraging good bacteria to thrive. It is also necessary if you have fish or shrimp or any other creatures breathing with gills living in the tank. Buy a standard air pump and an air stone at your local aquarium supplier. An aerator can also be a source of entertainment for your frogs. Many of them like to play with the air bubbles. The hum of the air pump can irritate the frogs’ sensitive ears. Try to isolate the pump by hanging it from a nail in the wall so it doesn’t touch the wall or the side of the tank.\\n5. v4-460px-Take-Care-of-an-Aquatic-Frog-Step-8-Version-3.jpg\\n6. Aquatic frogs feel more happy and secure if they have somewhere to hide. Use aquarium decorations or shelters specifically designed for aquatic frogs. You can also use live plants or soft artificial ones. Try using unpainted clay flower pots lying on their side in the tank. This is a perfect hiding place for your frogs, and it’s an easy and budget-friendly solution for you. Don’t use anything in the tank that is painted or glazed. Some of the chemicals can leach out into the water and poison your frogs.\\n7. Frogs don’t need to have anything covering the bottom of the tank, but it can be visually appealing. Buy a colorful aquarium gravel in a color that contrasts with your frogs so you can see them better. If you do use a substrate, buy an aquarium vacuum cleaner so you can vacuum out any bits of food or other debris every week so it doesn’t get stuck in the gravel and rot.\\n8. Your frog will need enough space to move around with ease. If you have more than one frog, you will need an extra 1 gallon (3.8 L) per frog. The more space, the better. Aquatic frogs, especially dwarf frogs, are not particularly strong swimmers, but they do need to come up to the surface of the water to breathe regularly. Anything deeper than 12 inches (30 cm) will make it too difficult for your frog to surface. If the tank is crowded, it will not only cause stress to your frogs, but it will also mean you will have to clean the water more often.\\n9. v4-460px-Take-Care-of-an-Aquatic-Frog-Step-4-Version-3.jpg', 'question_id': 1037695, 'answer_choices': [[2, 0, 9, 8, 5, 1, 7, 3, 4, 6], [5, 1, 4, 6, 7, 0, 8, 2, 3, 9], [8, 1, 6, 9, 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 3], [6, 7, 1, 9, 3, 5, 8, 0, 4, 2]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1037751.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-React-when-You-Find-Your-Girlfriend-Naked-in-Bed-With-Another-Guy-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-React-when-You-Find-Your-Girlfriend-Naked-in-Bed-With-Another-Guy-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n2. Your initial reaction may be sheer anger, but it's important not to do anything in the heat of the moment that you may regret. Avoid the temptation to scream or be violent; this is a situation that needs to be sorted out when you've fully processed what has happened, and screaming, crying, or violence now is only going to jeopardize your ability to do well in the future. Leave if you feel nothing else but a desire to behave violently. This needs to be sorted out when you're calmer; get out of the room, house or wherever you may be.\\n3. If you are in your own home or a shared home, ask him to leave. If he refuses, do not turn to violence, but rather explain that you need time to sort things out with your girlfriend. Be prepared for him to act violently, since you caught him in an offensive art. You should not be the one to start the violence but it is always clever to have a backup plan.

When your sibling does really well in a play or aces a math test, let him know that you are happy for him. If your sibling faces a fear (like singing in front of the whole school), congratulate him on being brave. Share in the happy moments with your sibling and be there with a smile to congratulate him.\\n1. If you’re crafty or like to make things, make something special for your sibling. You can make a friendship bracelet, origami paper crane, or a homemade card. If you feel really adventurous, try sewing a bag for your sibling or an article of clothing. Just make sure your sibling knows it was made just for him, with lots of love. The nice thing about making something is that your sibling can hold on to it and remember it was gift made from you.\\n2. It’s great to remember your sibling’s birthday, but remember other days that are important, too. You may want to wish your sibling good luck on a big presentation, or make a gift for your sibling after an orchestra performance. Show that you are proud to be a sibling and that you are happy to be in his life. Remember your sibling’s performances and make sure you attend them. Wish your sibling good luck on big exams. If you both have the day off of school, plan to spend it together doing fun things.

Your impulse might be to say “yes” to everything. This can result in you becoming exhausted, overbooked, and stressed out. Instead of defaulting to “yes,” be prepared to say “no.” You can do this by creating a structure for how you spend your time. Maybe you are cranky if you go out more than two evenings in one week. If this is the case, create a rule for yourself that two nights is your limit. If someone asks you to do something after your limit is reached, you'll feel justified saying no. You can also apply this to other situations. For example, agree to only participating in one fundraiser a semester at your child's school. Set a limit of meeting someone for lunch only one day during the workweek. Try to balance your schedule. On days when you have a lot of work responsibilities, schedule some time for self-care when you come home.\\n2. v4-460px-Say-No-Respectfully-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n3. You can't do everything, so it is important to be able to give a respectful “no.” Write down your priorities each day, and commit to getting them done. If someone asks you to do something not in line with those goals, you can say no. For example, maybe your list says, “finish presentation for Monday, write objectives for next week's department meeting, leave on time for Aunt Ruth's birthday dinner.” If a coworker asks you to stay late to help them with their own project, it is okay to say, “I'm sorry, I have a family commitment this evening.”\\n4. It's normal to feel guilty for turning someone down. To keep yourself from feeling this way, try to remind yourself of the positive aspects of saying no. For example, maybe you'll feel much more rested if you turn down an invite to a party. Or maybe you can focus on a major project at work if you turn down a smaller, less important opportunity.\", 'question_id': 10378, 'answer_choices': [[0, 1, 4, 3, 2], [4, 0, 3, 2, 1], [1, 0, 3, 2, 4], [3, 2, 1, 4, 0]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10379843.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. If you’re planning to store gasoline in your workplace, your containers will need to meet stricter standards than they would for home use. In the U.S., the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires that you use OSHA-approved safety cans. These cans must:\\nHave a capacity of 5 gallons (19 l) or less. Have a built-in flash arresting screen. Have a spring-closing lid and spout cover. Be designed to relieve internal pressure safely if the can is exposed to heat or fire. Be approved by a testing laboratory such as Factory Mutual Engineering Corp. or Underwriter’s Laboratories Inc., or a federal agency such as the Bureau of Mines or U.S. Coast Guard.\\n1. While capacity requirements may vary depending on your location, most fire codes specify that portable gasoline containers should hold no more than 5 gallons (19 l) of gas. In some places, there are even greater restrictions on the capacity of plastic gas containers versus metal ones. Check your local fire code to find out about capacity regulations in your area.\\n2. v4-460px-Store-Gasoline-Step-2.jpg\\n3. You can’t store gas safely in just any container. Look for a container that is labeled “gasoline” (or “petrol”), with appropriate warnings and information about the container’s capacity and safety features (such as spill-proof caps or flash arresting screens). Check the label for safety certifications (such as UN/DOT or UL) or indications that the container is approved by agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency.

Products that sound too good to be true, are to good to be true. Bulgarian beer has no effect on the size of your breasts, either. Chicken or other foods have no effect on your breast size. Drinking lots of water is good for you, but will not change the size of your breasts. Your sleeping position has no effect. Whether you wear a bra or not has no effect. Rubbing or squeezing your breasts will not change their size. Breasts do not get bigger with sex, or a lack thereof. Pumps and machines will not increase the size of your breasts. Breast size is partially controlled by estrogen. When taking the birth control pill some women will get larger breasts, while others will not. Such a change cannot be counted on and is considered a side-effect. Pregnancy increases bust size for the duration of the pregnancy and nursing period. Afterwards they go back to their normal size and sometimes get smaller than they were before. Breasts contain fat cells, so gaining weight will increase their size, unfortunately it will also increase your overall size.

To blend in better in social situations, try observing, rather than taking action. Observe how others around you socialize and communicate. You can then hang out and simply watch, rather than participate, in conversations. When you are observing others, you may also notice how certain groups socialize with each other. You may then try to socialize with them in the same way to blend in better with their social group.\\n2. Modulate your voice to fit the tone and volume of those around you. This way, you can blend into the existing environment and not startle or freak out others. In an office environment, this may mean keeping your voice low and unassuming when you speak. You may take on a gentle, low tone so you can blend into conversations going on around you or the quieter sounds of an office. In a foreign country, you should also be aware of the volume and tone of your voice. You do not want to be the tourist laughing and chatting loudly in a quiet local cafe.

Programs rarely work correctly the first time, so computer scientists need to be very resilient and able to take failures in stride. Do this through a strategy known as active coping, where instead of moping or getting upset, you channel your frustration into finding a new solution. Ask yourself a question like, “What can I do to fix this?”\\nDon’t be afraid to reach out to others if you’re struggling. Teamwork and communication are a big part of computer science and working with others provides new viewpoints and solutions you may not have thought of yourself.\\n2. v4-460px-Improve-Your-Memory-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\\n3. The scientific method is one of the most well-known ways to find out whether a possible solution will work or not. There are typically 6 main steps you’ll follow that will help you look at the problem objectively and evaluate the effectiveness of your hypothesis, which is essentially an educated guess on what is causing the problem or what will solve it. Step 1: Make an observation. Do some background research to begin brainstorming what could be the root of your problem. Step 2: Ask a question. This is where you’ll identify exactly what the problem is. Step 3: Form a hypothesis. This is a statement containing your proposed solution that you’ll be testing. Step 4: Test your hypothesis. Set up and run an experiment to find out if your solution will work. Step 5: Analyze the results. Look for patterns or trends in the data that indicate your idea was either effective or not effective. Step 6: Draw a conclusion. Based on your results, summarize the key findings. If your solution failed, use this step to begin coming up with a new hypothesis for another experiment.\\n4. Figure it out by asking yourself 5 different “why” questions that build on each other. The more questions you ask, the closer you’ll get to the real root of the problem. Say the problem you’re trying to solve is that you’re tired all the time. The first question to ask would be, “Why am I tired all the time?” If you answered, “Because I don’t get enough sleep,” the next question would be, “Why aren’t I getting enough sleep?” After answering, “Because I don’t go to bed until 2 a.m.,” ask yourself, “Why am I staying up so late?” Continue for at least 5 questions.', 'question_id': 10380903, 'answer_choices': [[4, 0, 3, 2, 1], [2, 0, 3, 4, 1], [2, 3, 0, 1, 4], [3, 1, 4, 0, 2]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10381118.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Window film is a very common window treatment for French doors as it offers a clean, modernized look, and allows sunlight to filter through. Just keep in mind that the film has to be measured, cut, and carefully applied to each individual glass pane on the French doors. This may be a project you need to tackle over a few days, but once it is completed, you will be happy with the results. To apply the window film you are going to have to treat it with a solution of water and film aid concentrate. Follow the manufacturing instructions on how to properly adhere the window film you picked out to avoid getting air bubbles or creases in the film.\\n1. v4-460px-Cover-Windows-on-Doors-Step-2.jpg\\n2. The slotted framework of the shutters will allow you to filter in as much or as little light into a room as you want.

For a modern look, get white shutters that will match the molding or framework within the room. This will tie the overall design of the room together. Wooden shutters that are simply polished and unpainted will give a rustic or farmhouse feel to any French door.

You can make a face out of any piece of wood as long as you can find a piece big enough for your  project. Some types of wood are more commonly used than others. Soft, inexpensive pieces of wood without much grain are good for beginners. Once you get more used to carving, you may wish to use stronger, sturdier, and more colorful wood. Basswood and butternut are a few types commonly used by beginners. You can often find them sold in premade blocks. Cottonwood, black walnut, and oak are a few options popular with experienced carvers. These woods are sturdier, have a noticeable grain, and are often used in commercial products. Woods come in various shapes and sizes, and qualities. With the right tools, you can even carve a face into an unrefined piece of lumber. You may find wood blocks easier to work with at first as you practice carving small details like eyes and hair.\\n1. To use the drawknife, lay the wood on a flat surface. Then, place the knife at the end of the wood and while gripping the 2 handles, pull the knife towards you to gradually scrape away the bark. Smaller, lighter pieces of wood must be clamped while you work to avoid accidents. You can get a drawknife online or at most tool supply stores. If you wish to avoid refining a piece of wood, look for premade wood blocks.

Every piece of wood is unique, so you owe it to yourself to give the wood a good inspection. Find out what features speak to you and decide how you will incorporate them into your carving. Holes, knots, and bumps are a few features that look more unique and natural when incorporated into carvings. For example, insect holes and discolorations can make a face look rustic. The face doesn't have to be perfect. These imperfections may end up making your carving more endearing. You can try incorporating rough spots into a beard or nose, for example, giving these features texture and making them more attention-grabbing.\", 'question_id': 10386174, 'answer_choices': [[0, 2, 1, 3, 4], [4, 1, 3, 0, 2], [1, 2, 3, 0, 4], [2, 3, 0, 4, 1]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10386249.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. The key to wearing a dress to school or college is to make sure you don't look like you're walking around ready for prom. Stay away from expensive formal stores, and instead look where you would normally shop for jeans and T-shirts. This is an easy way to find casual, comfy dresses for day to day wear. Look online in stores you'd never expect. No matter what a store specializes in, they probably have at least one casual dress.\\n1. Some specific styles are sure to be a hit. Wrap dresses - wrap dresses feature a wrap around the front that usually forms a v neck. Often they have a self tie around the waist or a hidden snap button or stitch to help keep the wrap panels together. Usually this style comes with super pretty short sleeves in a very light cotton fabric. This is an especially great style for school, because the sleeves lend it a comfy schoolgirl look. Spaghetti strap dresses - dresses with very thin straps are a super cute choice. The extra detail of a straight or square neckline that often accompanies this style is very unique. Keep in mind the dress code for this one. If your school doesn't allow it, you could try layering something under or over it, as described in the how to style portion. Button down dresses - the height of casual cute! These dresses have a long row of non functional buttons going in a line from the neck to the hem. These come in a variety of different styles so you're sure to find one you like. Short sleeve dresses - you can't go wrong with one of these. They come in so many different variations and are good for days when you want to be a little bit more conservative and cozy. They also cover the shoulders for those who have a stricter dress code. Overall dresses- Simply a pair of overalls with a skirt instead of pants at the bottom. A great transition if you're worried about wearing a dress to school. Usually worn with a T-shirt underneath, so you have lots of styling options. Because of the denim, this is a super cute and classic school outfit. T shirt dresses - another great way to make the change from not wearing dresses. Super comfortable as well as cute and offer a lot of styling options as well.

When you use a hole saw to cut a circle in wood there is a lot of torque created by the saw and you will cut all the way through the wood. Because of this you need to use clamps or have someone hold the wood while you drill it. You also need to make sure that there is open space below the wood so that the hole saw does not accidentally cut into anything it shouldn’t. For example, you can put the wood in a vise or have it hanging over the end of a table that you clamp the wood to.\\n5. If you cut straight through the wood without stopping, it can cause the backside to become jagged and rough when the hole saw pops through. To avoid this, cut part way through the hole and then flip the wood over. Stick the pilot bit in the existing pilot hole and start sawing. Your second cut will meet up with the first in the middle of the hole. This will give you a beautiful smooth cut on both sides of the board.\\n6. A hole saw is a metal circular saw that attaches to a drill. It is a quick and easy tool to use for cutting circles that are between .5–6 inches (1.3–15.2 cm) wide. Hole saws and their attachments are available at all hardware and home improvement stores. In addition to buying the hole saw, you will need to buy an arbor and a pilot bit for the saw. The arbor is the connecting piece that attaches the saw to the drill and the pilot bit guides the hole saw and it begins cutting. Hole saws create a small pilot hole at the center of the circle that they cut out. If you need the circle to be solid instead, you may not want to use a hole saw. If you need to use the circle of wood that is cut out, pay attention to the interior diameter of the hole saw you purchase. In general, the size of the hole saw refers to the exterior of the saw but the interior size will be listed in small print.\\n7. As you drill, the pilot bit will go through first and then the hole saw will drop onto the surface of the wood. Be prepared for this, making sure that you are holding the drill firmly and that you are ready to stop the drill if the saw gets caught on the wood when it first makes contact.', 'question_id': 10386383, 'answer_choices': [[1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 0, 5, 3], [6, 1, 4, 0, 7, 3, 5, 2], [2, 0, 6, 1, 5, 4, 7, 3], [2, 5, 6, 3, 0, 7, 1, 4]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10386718.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Choose a nutrient-rich potting soil from your local garden store and fill each cell of a seedling tray with the soil. Fill the cells roughly three-fourths of the way full with the soil, and make sure the cells have holes at the bottom for drainage. Seedling trays are perfect for sowing seeds as you can fill each 1 in (2.5 cm) cell with individual seeds and monitor their growth easily. Look for a seed starter soil blend, if desired.\\n1. Look for a packet of chili seeds at your local nursery or garden store, as well as online. If you already have chilis at home, wait until they’re overripe and cut them in half to remove the seeds. Once these seeds are dried out, you can plant them in the soil. An overripe chili will be red and beginning to shrivel a bit. Seeds from a chili that isn't ripe yet may not germinate because the seeds aren't mature. Dry the seeds by laying them out on a paper towel for several hours.\\n2. Use the same potting soil that you used to fill in the seed tray and sprinkle a thin layer over the seeds. This layer should be just thick enough to give the seeds protection against wind or water while allowing the seeds to grow up through it easily. When you water the seeds, the thin layer of soil on top should prevent the water from displacing the seeds. Still, water the seeds gently with a spray bottle or watering can to avoid disrupting them as they start.\\n3. v4-460px-Grow-Green-Chili-Step-4.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Grow-Green-Chili-Step-8.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Grow-Green-Chili-Step-2.jpg\\n6. v4-460px-Grow-Green-Chili-Step-6.jpg\\n7. Give the seeds a nice watering right after planting them, and then check the soil each day to ensure that it’s still damp. Be careful not to overwater the soil, as chili plants don’t like excessive amounts of water.

You don’t need to soak it until it becomes muddy. You’ll just want to soften the soil up a bit before you begin digging into it. You can also wait until the day after a rainstorm to start digging, if you’d rather not pour water on the ground yourself.\\n1. v4-460px-Level-a-Sloping-Garden-Step-4.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Level-a-Sloping-Garden-Step-2.jpg\\n3. Use the rise and run of your garden to calculate the number of terraces you’ll need to level it while maintaining each terrace’s structural integrity. Aim to have each terrace be no higher than 2 feet (0.61 m) and no longer than 5 feet (1.5 m) for best results. For example, if the vertical distance of your garden is 8 feet (2.4 m) and its horizontal distance is 20 feet (6.1 m), then you’ll need to build 4 terraces, each terrace being 2 feet (0.61 m) tall and 5 feet (1.5 m) long. Depending on the materials you use for your wall, as well as the steepness of your garden, you may want to build terraces that are longer than 5 feet (1.5 m) or taller than 2 feet (0.61 m). Although this is certainly possible, note that the risk of terrace walls bulging or collapsing tends to increase when they’re built to be longer or taller than these respective measurements.\\n4. Before you begin digging around your property, you’ll need to make sure there are no underground utility wires nearby that you might be disrupting. Get in touch with your local utility companies to make sure there are no underground wires your project may interfere with. You should also contact your local government agency responsible for city planning to confirm that your project will be in line with local building codes. In the United States, you can be put in touch with your local utility companies by calling 811. When you call 811, you’ll be connected to an operator who will evaluate your project and contact the relevant utility companies in your area so they can confirm the locations of underground utility infrastructure on your property. Although your project may seem small, many areas have bylaws and codes that specifically apply to garden terraces.', 'question_id': 10389856, 'answer_choices': [[4, 0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 4, 1, 2, 3], [4, 2, 3, 1, 0], [2, 1, 3, 4, 0]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1038986.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Open-a-Franchise-Step-12-Version-2.jpg\\n1. Like all business ventures, for a travel franchise business, you will need to hire an accountant or business consultant to draw up a business plan if you need a loan to get your business started. An accountant will help you to manage your finances effectively. Additional employees may be needed depending on the size or your franchise and the business plan. You can find and research professionals, such as accountants, on the internet, in a local phone directory, or through local organizations, such as a chamber of commerce. Local staffing agencies or advertisements in local papers can help you find the right employees to make your business a success.\\n2. v4-460px-Open-a-Franchise-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\\n3. First, you need to familiarize yourself with different aspects of the travel industry. Get as much information as possible about air travel, rail travel, cruises, hotels and vacation destinations. Also, learn about what type of travel packages are popular among customers and so on. You can search the internet or find books at the local library to help you research the many facets of the travel industry. Additionally, you can directly contact companies in the travel industry, such as cruise ship companies or hotels. You may want to consider a niche market depending on your specific location or interests. A niche market is a focus on a specific product or sector of an industry. Some niche markets to consider are cruises, local tours, a specific destination, corporate travel, or travel packages of interest to specific groups of people.\\n4. v4-460px-Choose-a-Cruise-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Become-a-Strategic-Planning-Consultant-Step-8.jpg\\n6. Obtain travel franchise business licenses and permits of the reputed travel company you chose. The franchise company you choose will provide you with these legal documents. Sign the franchise agreement after proper analysis. Review all the points mentioned in the agreement and ask the franchiser any questions you may have. Consider hiring an attorney to review any legal documents included in this process. Check with local government agencies for any additional licenses or permits that may be needed.\\n7.

Chip away at any problematic areas using your brick-set and hammer. Chiseling your paver can take a bit of practice to make a clean cut. For the first few times, you will likely have to take some time to even it out after the initial cut. Place your paver on a sandbag if it gets unsteady. Use a stone carving file to smooth out problematic spots. Push the file away from you and then lift it up instead of grinding it back and forth..\\n1. Place the paver onto a flat surface. Align the sharp edge over your chisel over the cutline. Begin gently tapping the handle with a hammer to create a groove in the paver. Continue tapping the chisel along the cutline. Repeat this process until there is a ⁄16 inch (0.16 cm) groove along the entire cutline of the paver. Avoid hitting the chisel too hard—you might break off too much of the paver. If you can't find a flat surface, place your paver onto a piece of plywood held up by 2 sawhorses.\\n2. v4-460px-Cut-Pavers-Step-4.jpg\\n3. Use a measuring tape to determine the measurements of the installation space. Be sure to get a measurement for all 4 sides of the space. Afterward, compare the measurements to your paver and determine what needs to be cut from your paver to make it fit. For example, your installation location might be a 7 by 7 inch (18 by 18 cm) square and your paver 7 by 8 inches (18 by 20 cm). In this case, you need to cut a 1 by 7 inch (2.5 by 17.8 cm) piece from the longer side of your paver.\\n4. v4-460px-Cut-Pavers-Step-2.jpg\", 'question_id': 10389921, 'answer_choices': [[3, 4, 1, 2, 0], [2, 1, 4, 3, 0], [2, 1, 3, 0, 4], [1, 3, 2, 0, 4]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1039021.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Loving yourself is often easier said than done, but you can do it! Be your own friend, and value what you bring to this world.

Korean BBQ is an all-you-can-eat style, but it is not a buffet, meaning that you will order food from a server who brings it to your table. Different restaurants have different payment methods, so check ahead of time to see if you will be expected to pay a flat rate per person or pay for each course. Your server will have great advice for people new to Korean BBQ, so don't be afraid to ask them any questions you have about the cuisine. You can expect to spend up to 2 hours at a Korean BBQ restaurant if you want to get the full experience, try every meat, and drink to your heart's content. Some Korean BBQ experts suggest bringing cash rather than using your card, as it can be difficult for your server to split a bill between multiple guests on cards.\\n1. v4-460px-Eat-Korean-BBQ-Step-4.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Eat-Korean-BBQ-Step-2.jpg\\n3.

Hold the print against the wall where you want to hang it. Make sure the print is straight and level before using any push pins. Either place a pin in each corner to hold the poster securely or place one in the top center. Use pins that are complementary to the colors of your print. For example, you may use an orange push pin if your poster is primarily blue. Using push pins will leave small holes in your poster and your wall. Use clear push pins if you don’t want them to be noticeable.\\n1. Poster frames are available at many big box retailers in common sizes. Remove the backing from the frame and set your poster inside.

You can find these online starting at around $500 USD. The kit should arrive with detailed assembly instructions and all the pre-cut pieces you need, usually made of MDF (an engineered wood fiberboard).

Remove the bottom 1/3 of a wine bottle or beer bottle with glass cutters. Attach rope, chain, or wire to the top of the wine bottle, so that it will hang with the cork down. Fill the bottle with soil and the plant of your choice, then hang it on a pergola, patio, or tree branch. For a pretty hanging option, twist thick wire in copper, gold, bronze, or silver around the bottle so it wraps up the body, starting at the neck. Use the same wire to hang it. Drill a hole in the cork to allow water to drain out of the soil. Wear protective eye wear and gloves when you're cutting glass.

When your boots or shoes start to look old and shabby, use them as makeshift flower pots instead of throwing them out. Any shoe will work but boots, like cowboy boots or work boots, are your best option since they have deep insides to fill with soil.

Use non-toxic outdoor spray paint to coat your tire in the color of your choice. Set your painted tire in your garden and fill the center hole with soil to plant your flowers. Ask your local mechanic or auto shop if they have old tires they don't want. Lighter colors like pastel pink or pale blue reflect light better so they won't get as hot in the sun.

If all your wall space is taken up by furniture, move some of the furniture 2 to 4 feet (0.61 to 1.22 m) from the wall to make the room seem larger. Group them together to create focal points that encourage different activities. Try and ensure that there are at least a few open spaces on the wall without furniture. Group chairs near the coffee table to encourage conversation. For couches, pull them a bit forward.

Select rods that extend 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) beyond the sides of the window frame for a traditional look. To make the window look wider, extend the rod 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 cm) beyond the edges. Use 95 in (240 cm) curtains so that they are long enough to touch the floor and place the rod brackets about 8 inches (20 cm) above the window frame.

When your non-dominant hand is above your dominant hand, grab the excess rope with your dominant hand between your thumb and index finger so it’s next to the rope already in your hand.\\n2. Hold your hands around 0.3 m (0.98 ft) apart so you have the knots in one hand and the 2 lines of rope in your other hand. Avoid curling your hands into fists; they should be flat with the rope pinched between your thumb and index finger. The rest of the rope will hang free on the opposite side of your dominant hand.\\n3. v4-460px-Store-Rope-Step-2.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Store-Rope-Step-4.jpg\\n5. Tightly wrap the remaining rope around the center of the figure 8. When you’ve got about 30 cm (12 in) left, wrap the rope over your thumb so it’s in the middle of the bundle. Fold the tail end of the rope into a loop and tuck it under the wrapped rope where your thumb is. Pull the loop to tighten the binding knot. When you're ready to use the rope, simply tug on the loop that you tucked under the wrapped rope. The entire hank will easily uncoil without tangling so you can access the rope quickly.\\n6. v4-460px-Store-Rope-Step-6.jpg\", 'question_id': 10397524, 'answer_choices': [[6, 1, 4, 0, 2, 3, 5], [6, 2, 4, 3, 1, 5, 0], [3, 6, 1, 0, 2, 5, 4], [0, 3, 2, 4, 1, 6, 5]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10397618.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Decorate-an-Entry-Table-Step-4.jpg\\n1. Pictures of your family, pets, or special events make your entryway feel more like a home. Not to mention they’re a great conversation starter when guests come into your house! Frame inspirational quotes for a little motivation before you leave each day or quirky prints that express your personal style. Find handwritten quotes or original prints and artwork on Etsy or at craft fairs and art stores that you can put into fun frames. For a more polished table, print your photos in black and white. Colorful frames lend a playful touch while mirrored or metallic frames are more statement-making. Choose frames in a variety of sizes, shapes, and colors to add dimension and visual interest. Or you can create a gallery wall by using different photos of different sizes, all hung in matching frames.\\n2. v4-460px-Decorate-an-Entry-Table-Step-2.jpg\\n3. Harsh overhead lights aren’t exactly inviting, but it's important to make sure your entryway is well-lit to welcome guests. An antique lantern or accent lamp add a warmer glow to the room. Groups of candles are a more romantic lighting option. Candles aren’t the most practical. If you like the look, choose battery-powered candles that you can easily turn on instead of having to find the lighter. Light bulbs make a difference. Make sure you have enough light in your entryway for your guests to be able to see around them. For a golden glow, look for bulbs that are 2,700 Kelvins or less. Avoid any labeled as “cool white.”\\n4. Symmetry is very clean and easy on the eyes. Imagine a line dividing the table in half. Everything you place on the left side, place in the same spot on the right side, too. For example, a square picture frame in the center of the left side should have a matching square frame in the center of the right side. You don’t have to put the exact same objects on both sides. Focus on choosing objects with similar sizes or shapes, instead. An elephant figurine on one side could be mirrored on the other side by a jar that’s the same height. To keep it from being boring, mix up textures and materials or add plants. Pair metal frames with burlap vases filled with hydrangeas. Symmetry won't work for every entryway.

The check engine light on your vehicle’s dashboard will let you know when the computer identifies an issue with the engine’s operation. While you usually need an OBDII scanner to read the error codes that prompt a check engine light, a misfire is the only thing that will make the light flash on and off. The check engine light will flash as the engine misfires, but it may stop if the misfire stops as well.

If a cylinder in your engine isn’t working, it may be running unspent fuel through the exhaust. That not only means a loss of power, but also reduced fuel economy. If your vehicle’s gas mileage suddenly gets much worse, it’s likely a sign of a misfire. Reset the trip odometer on your dashboard when you fill up your gas tank to see how many miles you make it before you need another fill up.

Inexpensive glass cutters have steel blades, so a steel file works as an approximate replacement. If you don't have a steel file, you can purchase one at a hardware store for under $10 USD.

To cut glass with steel, you'll position the sharp edge (or pointed tip) of the file against the mirror, then scrape it back and forth until you've lightly scored the glass. Be aware that using a rough steel edge (like a file) to cut glass may result in an imprecise cut and a sloppy break.

In most cases, being honest and direct is the best course of action. It shows that you’re willing to own up and take responsibility and that you respect the teacher enough not to try to mislead them with a cooked-up story. Explain why you didn’t do the homework--maybe you forgot about the assignment, got home late, fell asleep, etc. Don’t sugarcoat your reason, but do use some discretion; if you didn’t do your homework because you were at an all-night kegger, keep your reason general (ie, “I didn’t get home until late”) rather than overly specific (ie, “I was too busy doing keg stands”). Apologize. After giving your reason, sincerely apologize. Don’t gloss over this part--the sincerity of your apology will impact how likely your teacher is to want to help you. Explain that it won’t happen again--and make sure it doesn’t. Let your teacher know that this was a rare instance of you lapsing on a responsibility and that you’ll be careful that it doesn’t happen again. And--this part is important--keep your word. If you make forgetting your homework habitual, your teacher will not only stop believing your excuses, they’ll rapidly become less sympathetic to your apologies. Ask for another day to finish the assignment. The best case scenario here is that your teacher will grant you extra time to complete the assignment and won’t penalize you for turning it in past the original deadline. More likely, though, your teacher will offer to let you turn in the assignment late, for partial credit. Don’t gripe about or be ungrateful for partial-credit--it will make it less likely that your teacher will extend you a similar opportunity in the future.\\n2. If all else fails and you have to concoct a story, at least make it a good one. If the story’s creative or amusing enough, your teacher might cut you some slack simply because you didn’t give them one of the same boring excuses they always hear. For example, maybe it just so happened that your parents went out last night and left you with a family friend who turned out to be a clairvoyant and burned all of your homework because he looked into the future and saw that if he didn’t destroy it all your cat would rip your homework to shreds while you slept and you would breathe in a fatal amount of air-borne paper bits and choke to death.', 'question_id': 1040083, 'answer_choices': [[1, 2, 0], [1, 0, 2], [2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 2]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10401025.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Decorate-a-Wedding-Car-with-Ribbon-Step-4.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Decorate-a-Wedding-Car-with-Ribbon-Step-6.jpg\\n2. In many cases, this won’t be a problem, but it’s always good to check. Check with the company to ensure they will allow decorations on the car, and to see if there are any limits to what you can and can’t include. Some companies may also require that you purchase a decoration package from them instead of decorating yourself. Ask to see if this is the case for you.

Since these decorations have to wait outside for the couple, they need to be able to withstand the weather. If it looks like rain on the day of the wedding, consider laminating paper banners or choosing a water-resistant material. Likewise, think about what the ground outside the venue will be like. If it’s going to be wet and muddy, think about using dark-colored ribbons that will hide the dirt.\\n5. In addition to a color palette, some weddings have themes like art deco, shabby chic, or rock ‘n’ roll. Ask the couple if their wedding will have a theme. If so, look for decorations that fit the overall style and aesthetic of the theme. For example, if the wedding is shabby chic, you can make a “Just Married” banner for the windshield out of burlap or card stock and twine. If the wedding theme is rock ‘n’ roll, paint the banner on old 45 rpm vinyl records.\", 'question_id': 10401025, 'answer_choices': [[1, 2, 3, 0, 5, 4], [4, 2, 5, 3, 0, 1], [4, 2, 5, 3, 0, 1], [2, 3, 5, 0, 4, 1]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10401045.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

Find 2 trees, posts, concrete walls, or other solid objects. Measure the distance between them to make sure your slackline is long enough.

Many books have been written about calculus (or mathematics in general) as a general field of study. These are not just textbooks. Many authors have written about the human applications of calculus, about the history of it, and about the general enjoyment that can come from understanding it. You should seek out such literature and read it. The more you learn about the topic -- beyond just learning how to do it -- the more you will appreciate and enjoy it. For example, some books on the subject of calculus include:\\n\\nZombies & Calculus, by Colin Adams. This is written by a humor columnist, as a piece of “zombie fiction.” The heroes of the novel use tangent vectors, logistic growth, gravitational acceleration and other calculus-related topics to escape and defeat a pack of zombies. The Magic of Math, by Arthur Benjamin. Using simple explanations and real life examples, the author explains a variety of math concepts, including calculus, from the basis of being a magician. Beyond Numeracy, by John Allen Paulos. This book consists of brief essays on a range of topics, including calculus. Calculus is explained from the perspective of driving along the New Jersey Turnpike with a broken speedometer.\\n2. It is possible to understand the general concepts behind calculus without knowing much other math, but a strong foundation will help. If you are setting out to understand and enjoy calculus, it will help if you have a strong understanding of algebra, geometry and trigonometry. The more you understand these concepts, the more you will be able to do with your work in calculus. If you study the building block subjects thoroughly, you will find calculus a much easier subject. If you are still in high school, you should work with your math teachers to make sure you understand the basics as much as possible. Meet with your guidance counselor to plan your math classes. Map out a schedule over your high school years so that you will get to include calculus in your schedule by the time you graduate.', 'question_id': 1040568, 'answer_choices': [[2, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1], [2, 0, 1]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10405693.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Plan-a-Trip-to-Tirupati-Step-2.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Plan-a-Trip-to-Tirupati-Step-4.jpg\\n2. The best time of year to spend in Tirupati is September through March because of its pleasant weather and comfortable temperatures. However, keep in mind that this is the time of year when most tourists plan their trips, so the city may be more crowded. Tirupati experiences very hot and humid temperatures throughout their summers, the worst months being April and May. Visitors tend to avoid the extreme heat and humidity, which also means that the city is less crowded during this time.\\n3. Tirupati is known for its fairs and festivals. These events are held year round and offer a variety of celebrations including religion, food, and music. Possible events to attend are Tirumala temple Brahmotsavam, the Vijayanagara festival, and the Gangamma Jatra. If you are in Tirupati while one of these events is happening, it would be worth it to attend. Keep in mind that while these events are going on, there will be more natives and tourists flooding the city. If you aren’t a fan of crowds, then you may want to plan your trip around these events.

If your bike came with an instruction or maintenance manual, it will usually have pedal removal and installation instructions. Read these thoroughly to see if there is anything particular that you need to do with your specific bike. The instructions will also detail whether you need a 15mm wrench or a hex key to remove the pedals. Check to see if the manual has a table of contents so that you can skip to the pedal or crank section. If your bike didn't come with a manual, you can still determine what kind of tools you'll need to remove them.\\n2. Most basic or flat pedals require a 15mm wrench rather than a hex key.

Make a ball of clay about ⁄2 in (1.3 cm) in diameter. Mold it into a symbolic object associated with Ganesh, such as rope or uneaten sweets, and place it in the upward facing palm. To make a rope, simply roll the small ball of clay into a long, thin cylinder. Next, curl it into a loop and place it on Ganesh's palm. Make uneaten sweets by dividing the clay ball into 3 or 4 smaller balls, then place them in the upward facing palm.\\n1. Painting the murti is optional; many people now prefer the natural look of an unpainted clay idol. If you do paint it, go for natural, vegetable-based paints instead of metallic or chemical-based products. Vermilion, which is a deep red, would be a good color choice. It's associated with Ganesh and religious festivals. Vegetable-based paints are eco-friendly and won’t harm the body of water in which you immerse the murti. In some areas, idols are required to be unpainted or colored with non-toxic pigments. Search online for your city's government website to check your local ordinances, or look for newspaper articles on regulations related to Ganesh Chaturthi.\\n2. Immersing murti in water sends Ganesh, who has resided in the idol to listen to your prayers, back to his heavenly abode. Terracotta clay and other natural choices will dissolve during the immersion ritual. Not only is this consistent with the ritual’s spiritual meaning, it’s better for the environment. During Ganesh Chaturthi, hundreds of thousands of idols may be immersed in a single city. Idols made of materials that don't dissolve, such as plaster of Paris, pollute the bodies of water in which they’re immersed. In some areas, laws require Ganesh murti to be made of natural clay. Furthermore, undissolved idols are often removed from bodies of water, gathered into piles, and destroyed, which disrespects Ganesh.\\n3. v4-460px-Decorate-Ganesh-Murti-at-Home-Step-4.jpeg\\n4. Roll 2 pieces of clay into 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) long tubes with diameters of about 1 ⁄2 in (3.8 cm). Then attach 1 end of each tube to the rear and bottom of the body to form the legs. Bend the legs so they curl around the front of the body in a sitting position, then smooth 1 end of each leg to the back of body to form the hip joints. Remember that toothpicks or small sticks can help you attach the body parts to each other if you have trouble keeping the idol stable.\\n5. Place 2 small tusks on either side of the trunk, then make a crown by stacking 2 or 3 clay cylinders about 2 in (5.1 cm) in diameter and ⁄2 in (1.3 cm) thick on top of the head. Ganesh has a broken tusk, so make one about 1 in (2.5 cm) long and the other about ⁄2 in (1.3 cm) in length. Both tusks should be tubes about ⁄4 in (0.64 cm) thick, and the longer one should taper to a point.

Acting cool at work may be a lot different than acting cool in middle school, but you can learn to identify the different cool and uncool crowds, and tailor your coolness accordingly. In a very large group, like a whole middle school or a whole company, try to find a smaller group of people to befriend and be cool with. Situate yourselves as the \"in\" group in opposition to the lamestream, er, the mainstream. In a smaller group, it might be more appropriate to remain aloof to play it cool.

Black widow spiders are found across the U.S and Canada, and in other temperate regions around the world. They are the most venomous spiders in North America. The female is the easiest to recognize -- and the most dangerous. She is coal-black, with a spherical abdomen and a red hourglass-shaped mark on her belly. Her body is approximately half an inch long, but she has a total length of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) with her legs extended. The male is about half the size of the female and is brown or grey. He usually has several red dots on his abdomen and may have a yellow or red band across his back. Male black widow spiders are not venomous. Young black widows, known as spiderlings, are white or yellow-white when they first hatch. They become darker as they grow. They may have yellow or red patches across their backs, resembling the adult male. It is impossible to tell male and female spiderlings apart. At this stage, both are harmless to humans.\\n1. v4-460px-Get-Rid-of-Black-Widow-Spiders-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n2. Female Black Widow spiders have very powerful venom -- in fact, it is said to be15 times stronger than that of a rattlesnake. The venom is a neurotoxin. Symptoms include muscle aches, abdominal pain, breathing difficulties and nausea. The majority of Black Widow bites are easily treated. However, if medical treatment cannot be administered on time, a Black Widow bite can lead to convulsions and death. Black Widow spiders are not aggressive and will only bite as a defense mechanism. Most bites occur when the spider is accidentally disturbed or injured, and feels threatened. Small children, the elderly and the infirm are much more susceptible to adverse reactions when bitten by a Black Widow. Medical treatment should be sought immediately.\\n3. v4-460px-Get-Rid-of-Black-Widow-Spiders-Step-2-Version-2.jpg', 'question_id': 1041078, 'answer_choices': [[0, 3, 2, 1], [2, 1, 3, 0], [0, 2, 1, 3], [3, 1, 0, 2]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1041090.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. The motherboard connects all the other components to one another. It is the physical base upon which you build everything else. It contains a lot of your machine’s core features, like the number of USB ports, the number of expansion cards you can put in (such as graphics card, etc), and also partially determines how big your computer size will be. Which motherboard you pick will depend on whether you build a low, medium, or high performance machine. As you look at motherboards, you’ll want to pay attention to quite a few things. Here are some of the more important features:\\n\\nSocket Type: Your socket type (such as AMD’s \"AM2\", “AM3”, \"AM3+\" socket, or Intel’s “LGA 1151”,etc) determines which processors you can use with that board. So, if you’ve already narrowed down the kind of processor you want, this is a good first step to narrowing down your motherboard. Look for a model with a socket type that matches your processor to ensure that the two are compatible. Size: Motherboards generally come in three sizes: Mini ITX, Micro ATX, and full ATX. The more advanced features you need, the larger the motherboard will need to be, which will also determine the size of your case. Number and Types of External Ports: Look at the ports available on the motherboard. Do you need a lot of USB ports? You’ll either want a motherboard that has them or enough PCI slots to support extra USB adapters. Do you need HDMI out? If you aren’t using a graphics card, make sure your motherboard has the right video output for your monitor. How many USB 3.0 ports do you want? Some have more than others. If you’re set on a motherboard that doesn’t have a feature you need, you can add most with expansion cards, but life is always easier if the motherboard has them built in. Amount of Supported RAM: If you plan on having a lot of RAM in your machine, you’ll need a motherboard that supports it. Look at how many slots your board has, and how much RAM it allows for. Integrated Graphics: If all you’re going to do is browse the web, use Microsoft Office, and perform other simple tasks, you may be better off choosing a motherboard with integrated graphics. You only need to shell out for a separate graphics card if you’re playing video games. If you’re getting a separate graphics card, then don\\'t choose motherboard with integrated graphics as this may save some cost. Number of SATA Ports: This determines how many internal hard drives and optical drives you can have. For most builds, this is only really a concern if you plan on having a lot of drives in your computer (like if you’re building a server or a NAS).. Number of PCI Slots: You can only have as many expansion cards as you have PCI slots, so if you want a dedicated video card (or two), extra USB ports, extra LAN ports, a Wi-Fi adapter, or other expansion cards, you need to make sure your motherboard has enough of them. Chipset: Your motherboard’s chipset determines a lot of the more advanced features it has. Some chipsets support overclocking, some do not. Some support SLI and Crossfire (using multiple video cards in tandem), some do not. Others support SSD caching. Others are better for turning into Hackintoshes. If you didn’t understand any of the things I just said, you probably don’t need to pay too close attention to this—but if you want certain advanced features, chipset will narrow your selection considerably. Generally, the more of these features you require on the motherboard, the larger in size and price they become, so keep that in mind as you ponder. Brands to Watch For: ASUS, GIGABYTE, and MSI are probably the biggest names in motherboards. However, BIOSTAR and ASRock are well known for good budget boards, if you’re trying to keep the cost down.\\n1. Even with the following steps, this process is going to be overwhelming—especially if you don’t keep up with all the latest hardware news (as many of us don’t). Note that these descriptions are bound to become outdated as time goes on, so in addition to reading the information below, check out some pre-built systems comparable to what you want to build. That’ll help you figure out what kind of processor applies to mid-range builds, how much RAM you’d find in a high-end build, and so on. You should also consider the OS you want to run, and the programs you’ll be using, and check their recommended system requirements. Make sure you avoid bottlenecks, where one component can’t reach its full potential because another part is too slow. There will be a few reputable brands mentioned in each category, but we recommend reading up on when brand really matters (and when it doesn’t) so you don’t fall into advertising trap.\\n2. v4-459px-Build-a-Cheap-PC-Step-9.jpg\\n3. v4-459px-Build-a-Cheap-PC-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\\n4. The case holds all of your computer’s parts together. It is less about features of how your computer runs and more about features that affect you and your home—that is, how quiet it is, how big it is, and how it looks. Still, it’s an important consideration that is dependent on your other choices, so you might want to think about what you want in terms of a case before moving on to the shopping step (some cases come with their own PSU which increase their overall cost, also you might want to check their power rating Watts and how much you require).Your case may not seem like a super important part of your build, but it’s about more than looks. A good case will be easier to build in, last you a long time, and keep your machine cool. Here’s what you’ll need to look for:\\n\\nSize: Cases come in a number of shapes and sizes, and what size case you choose should match the kind of motherboard you’re buying. If you chose a Mini-ITX motherboard, then a Mini-ITX Tower or Mini-ITX Desktop box is for you. A Micro ATX mini tower is the size you’ll find in most pre-built computers, so know that mid and full towers are probably bigger than what you’re used to. Airflow: This is something you’ll have to look for in user reviews. Every case is a little different, and the better your fans are placed, the better airflow you’ll have inside (which will keep your computer from overheating). Noise: While you want good airflow, some fans are particularly loud, which can be annoying to some people. If you want your computer to stay relatively quiet, check the user reviews and see what people say about the case’s loudness. Number of Drive Bays: If you need more than just a hard drive an optical drive, count the number of drive bays on your case and make sure you have enough. Keep in mind other things, like card readers, will take up drive bays as well. Internal 3.5” drive bays are for hard drives, external 3.5” drive bays are for card readers, and external 5.25” drives are for optical drives (and other stuff). Ports on the Front: Almost every case you buy will have a number of ports on the front, which usually include a few USB ports, a headphone jack, and a microphone jack. If you want easy access to USB 3.0, for example, you’ll want to make sure it’s on the front of your case. Cable Management: As you build, you’ll realize there are a lot of cables inside a computer. Unfortunately, if you just leave them hanging where they fall, they’ll block a lot of air from flowing correctly through the case, so you want to organize them as best you can. Some cases have built-in holes through which you can route cables, while some leave you to figure it out yourself with zip ties. The former is, obviously, a lot less work, so see what user reviews say about cable management options. Keep in mind that a case is something you can use for multiple builds down the road. You don’t need to buy a new case every time you build a computer. Get a quality one now and it should last you two or three computers into the future. Brands to Watch for: Corsair, NZXT, Antec, and Cooler Master both make some of the best cases on the market. Thermaltake, Rosewill, Fractal Design,and Silverstone are also trusted manufacturers.\\n5. v4-459px-Build-a-Cheap-PC-Step-11.jpg\\n6. Random Access Memory (or RAM for short) stores data your computer needs quick access to. The size determines how fast your programs run, and help you run more programs at one time. Thus, if you run a lot of programs at once, you’ll want a computer with more RAM. If you use virtual machines, you’ll want higher RAM, since it has to run its own programs in addition to yours. RAM seems simple, but you need to make sure it’s compatible with your motherboard. When looking at RAM, think about:\\n\\nType of Computer: Since most system now are 64 bit, some older model CPU\\'s are 32 bit, especially if you are buying second hand parts. You must know that 32 bit CPU\\'s can only handle 4 GB of RAM. Amount of RAM: At the time of this writing, 4-16 GB seems to be the average for a normal machine. If you’re running virtual machines or using other RAM-hungry apps, you might want 16 GB, but most machines should be fine with around 8 GB. Keep in mind that RAM is easy to upgrade, and if your motherboard has four slots, you can always get two sticks now and add two more sticks later. There’s no need to get a ton of RAM now in the name of “future-proofing”. Channels: Your motherboard will support either dual, triple, or quad channel RAM. This decides how many sticks of RAM you get. If you have a dual channel motherboard, you’ll want to buy RAM in sets of two—for example, two 2GB sticks for a total of 4GB (or four 1GB sticks). Triple channel motherboards take RAM in sets of three, and quad channel is most optimal with a set of four or eight sticks. Type: Most RAM nowadays is “DDR4”, though DDR5 and DDR5X is starting to pop up in graphics cards. You shouldn’t have to worry about this too much. Just check your motherboard’s spec list to find out what type of RAM it supports and buy accordingly. Speed: Your motherboard will support a number of different RAM speeds (e.g., “800/1066/1333”). When you buy your RAM, it will have one of these numbers attached to it. RAM speed traditionally doesn’t make a huge difference, but it’s starting to become more useful. Buy what you can afford, and make sure your motherboard supports it. Brands to Watch For: You won’t find a huge difference between brands. Popular brands include Crucial, Corsair, Kingston, PNY, OCZ, G.Skill, Mushkin, and Patriot. Again, reading reviews of specific sticks of RAM can be very helpful.\\n7. v4-459px-Build-a-Cheap-PC-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\\n8. The kind of hard drive you choose will be determined mainly by how much data you need to store, but certain kinds of hard drives (like solid state drives) can also affect your computer’s speed. When it comes to specs, there are a few things you want to look for in your drives:\\n\\nSize: Obviously, you want enough space on your hard drive to hold all your data, with room for expansion. Hard drives are pretty cheap and easy to upgrade, so you can always add more later if you’re on a budget. Speed: The faster your hard drive is, the faster your computer will boot, launch programs, and open files. These days, you get a 7200 RPM drive for a relatively cheap price. Brands to Watch For: Western Digital, Hitachi, Samsung, and Toshiba are all good choices. Seagate is also popular, though it has lately gotten a bad reputation for low reliability. Most hard drive manufacturers have a lot of mixed reviews.\\n9. v4-459px-Build-a-Cheap-PC-Step-3-Version-2.jpg', 'question_id': 1041090, 'answer_choices': [[1, 5, 9, 3, 7, 6, 2, 0, 4, 8], [6, 2, 1, 9, 8, 3, 7, 5, 4, 0], [3, 7, 0, 2, 5, 6, 9, 4, 1, 8], [1, 9, 0, 7, 6, 3, 8, 2, 4, 5]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10411633.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Stronger bones may help you heal your knock knees faster. Your body produces vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. Make an effort to spend at least 5-10 minutes outside at least 2-3 times per week.

If you have a wooden table, you might opt for a marble tray, while a wooden tray looks great with a sleek metal table. Trays work for holding decorative items as well as for serving your table a meal.\\n5. A traditional tablecloth in a fabric that compliments the décor of your dining room is a good choice. If you want to leave some of the tabletop on display, choose a table runner or placemats, or both. Neutral fabric coloured white, beige, grey, stone etc with textures compliment most rooms, you can make a statement with bold colours or patterns if you prefer. Table linens are very practical, protecting the table from spills during meals. Try using placemats on top of your tablecloth to add layers to your table.

To keep with tradition, add marigolds or mango leaves to your toran and hang it across the outside of your front door for an auspicious and colorful piece of decor. Most toran have flowers or leaves on them. However, if you don’t have any fresh flowers, you can also fold paper flowers or [[Fold a Paper Leaf|leaves out of decorative paper, or simply cut pieces of cardboard or craft paper into flower shapes and hang these from the toran.

Dust, sweep, do the laundry, clean all the rooms. It's customary to thoroughly clean your home to help welcome the Goddess Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth and fortune, during the celebrations. Diwali also marks the start of the new year, so getting rid of old clutter and negativity feels like a fresh start for many. Many Hindus and even non-Hindus also wait for Diwali to redecorate and paint their walls. To add some extra style without painting the whole house, you might sponge paint your room or just a single wall. Usually, the guests and relatives are seated in the living room during celebrations. So you can take a little extra care to decorate your living room. Don't worry if your living room is not very big or fancy; having a clean, aromatic and well-lit room does the trick.\\n3. v4-460px-Decorate-Your-Home-for-Diwali-Step-2.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Decorate-Your-Home-for-Diwali-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n5.

Your window covering shouldn’t be taut when it’s closed, so you want something wider than the actual width of your window. For example, if your window is 36 inches (91 cm) wide, look for a window treatment that’s 72 to 90 inches (180 to 230 cm) wide. An exception is if your window treatment is just going to frame the window. Then you won’t need to worry about the width.\\n2. v4-460px-Decorate-Windows-Step-10.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Decorate-Windows-Step-6.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Decorate-Windows-Step-8.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Decorate-Windows-Step-2.jpg\\n6. Whether you choose a vibrant abstract print, a Greek key pattern, or a delicate floral, patterned curtains make a stylish statement in any space. Look for patterns that pick up the colors in the room to create a cohesive feel. For a more subdued effect, choose a smaller print like a narrow stripe or tiny dots. Don’t be afraid to mix patterns, as long as they balance each other. For instance, if you have a bold paisley rug, complement it with curtains in a simple chevron print.\\n7. Ready-to-hang curtain panels typically range in length from 63 to 144 inches (160 to 370 cm). If you can’t find window treatments that fit your width or length, have them custom-made from a fabric store, home store, or online retailer. Another option is to get curtains that are longer than you’d like and then either hem them yourself or take them to a seamstress. Custom curtains will be more expensive and cannot be returned so be sure about your decision before you order them.\\n8. The heading of the curtains is what you hang on the rod. Hooks are the most traditional style and the easiest to open. They’re best if you’re going to be opening and closing the curtains often. Curtains with grommets are also a good option. Rod-pocket curtains are some of the most common. They have a fabric pocket that the rod slides into. These are not meant to be opened and closed, though. Tabs are very casual. These also come in ties, which can be tied in bows for a girly look.\\n9. A rod that is wider than the window makes the window look bigger. It also gives you room on each side to push the curtains open to frame the window. For extra wide windows, look for extra long rods that have an extendable piece. Rods that are too short also block light.\\n10. Sweeping the window treatment to the side with a tieback not only adds a glamorous vibe, it shows off what’s outside the window and lets sunlight in.

A rocks glass is a small glass tumbler that holds between 6 to 10  fl oz (180 to 300 mL). These are often decorative and you can purchase them alone or as part of a whiskey decanter set.

These parts are essential to the shaping process. To find the handhold, make marks three inches above and below the center point of the bow.

There are a few things to consider when selecting raw wood for your bow:\\nFind a piece of dry and dead (but not gray or cracking) hardwood (such as oak, lemon tree, hickory, yew, black locust, teak, ash, juniper, or madroño) about 1.8 meters (about 6 feet) [or as tall as you may be] in length. The wood should be free of knots, twists or limbs, and it would be helpful if the branch is thick at its center. This piece of wood should be somewhat flexible, such as juniper or mulberry. You can even use a shaft of bamboo or cane but take care that it is not too thick. For that, you can use young bamboo which is strong as well as flexible. Green wood (living wood that you cut from a tree or sapling) can be used if absolutely necessary but should be avoided because it does not provide the same power as dry wood.\\n4. v4-460px-Make-a-Bow-and-Arrow-Step-08-Version-2.jpg\\n5. Use your knife to cut notches that begin at the sides and curve around toward the belly of the bow and in toward the handhold as they go. There should be one on each side about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) from each end of the bow. Remember not to cut into its back, and do not make the notches deep enough to compromise the strength of the tips. Make them just deep enough to hold the string in place.\\n6. You will need to tie a loose loop with a very secure knot at both ends of your bowstring before slipping it over the lower, and then upper, limb of your bow.

Make an effort to see things from your sibling’s perspective. They may believe that they have a valid reason for acting the way they do. Acknowledging their feelings will help you talk to them in a way that they’ll respond to. A brother or sister who\\'s significantly younger, for instance, may feel entitled to special treatment from your parents because they\\'ve always been catered to. Getting a grasp of your sibling’s motivations doesn’t mean giving them a pass to do whatever they please. If anything, it leaves you better armed to confront their selfishness effectively.\\n2. If there’s just no getting through to your sibling, you may be tempted to cut off all contact with them. Before you do, however, consider how doing so might impact the rest of your family. Generally, it’s best to try to patch things up with your siblings as best you can rather than putting yourself at odds with them for good. Feuding with a sibling could cause them to feel unwelcome at holiday gatherings or refuse to let their kids play with yours. These sorts of outcomes can be hurtful to more people than just the two of you. Severing ties with a sibling may be the best option if their behavior has reached the point of becoming abusive or exploitative, or if the only interactions you have with them are negative.\\n3. Remind your brother or sister that family comes first. Even if they feel justified in their position, the idea of hurting the people closest to them may lead them to make things right, or at least reconsider their actions. For example, if one of your brothers is bitter after being burned in a bad business deal with the other, encouraging them to be the bigger person may convince them to reach out and end their grudge. Don’t go for a guilt trip by saying things like, ”Dad would be so disappointed in you.” Instead, stress the importance of taking the high road with a gentle admonition: \"Dad raised us to be forgiving, remember?\"\\n4. v4-460px-Deal-with-Greedy-Siblings-Step-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10415079, 'answer_choices': [[2, 0, 3, 4, 1], [3, 4, 0, 2, 1], [3, 2, 1, 4, 0], [1, 4, 3, 0, 2]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10415305.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. A smaller Emmy watch party with 3-5 of your good friends can be a great way to kick back and enjoy the show. You can go with a more relaxed theme or go all out and get dressed up together. Throwing a smaller party also lets you save money on food and decorations.\\n1. Many people choose to hold their Emmy parties at their house or apartment, in a big living room space or common area that can accommodate all the guests. If the fall weather is pleasant enough, you could even hold your Emmy party out in your backyard by setting up some big, comfy outdoor chairs, a screen, and a projector to stream the show. If you want an even fancier feel for a larger party, you could rent out a ballroom or large meeting space at a hotel or community meeting center.

Make sure to specify the dress code, the date, and when guests should show up. Invitation Tips\\nSpecify the time. Ask guests to come over just before the show starts, or earlier to watch the fashion on the red carpet. Make sure to specify either way on your invites. If you’d like your guests to pitch in for food and drink, say so on the invitation. Specify that the party will be a potluck, or add a simple BYOB to tell guests to bring their own drinks to share. Match the invitations to the tone of the night. If the party will be fancier, you can get creative with ribbons or glitter.

You can buy mounting or poster tape sold as either a roll which you cut up into tabs, or as pre-cut individual tabs. Place the sticky sides of the tabs face down on the back of the poster in each corner, and remove the film covering before pressing it firmly against the wall to mount it. Use your hands to flatten and smooth out any wrinkly portions of the poster after you’ve put it on the wall. You can remove the poster from the wall without damaging it in any way. The same may not be the case for your poster when you try to remove the tape tabs.

Emotions drive our decision making, according to recent neurological studies. Without feeling some emotion towards a decision, it is nearly impossible to define a position on a topic. Understanding that decision making and emotions are connected can help you become emotionally aware, which you can use to your advantage. For example, if you are making a decision at work that frightens you, recognize your decision might be biased, and make a logic-based, instead of a fear-based decision.\\n2. After you acknowledge you are feeling an emotion, accept the feeling and any consequence associated with it. By staying accountable to your emotional responses, you can make positive steps to fix or change the response. For example, if you are feeling sad, and are mean to a loved one in response, take ownership of your emotional response. Then reach out to the person and apologize, explaining to them you were acting upon your emotions.\\n3. There is likely an underlying root for not showing your emotions. Perhaps you grew up in an environment where showing your emotions was frowned upon, or you are suppressing strong emotions so you don’t have to deal with them. Think about events in your life that may have been tragic that you haven’t dealt with. Do you fear talking about those events?

Koreans traditionally don't eat rice with chopsticks. A spoon is best for scooping up heaping mouthfuls of the bibimbap. Chopsticks can help you pile more ingredients onto your spoon. If you don't want your rice to get crispy, use your spoon to scrape the bottom of the bowl every so often while you eat to mix it up.\\n1. A quick tossing won't work here. Using a spoon, mix the ingredients vigorously so all of the flavors blend together. Stirring inside the hot bowl also keeps the dish warm all the way through.

Listen to the instruments and singing in the music, and only take steps to the side, forward, or backward when you hear bass beats. During other instrumental music, dance in one place with your partner or alone. Different Types of Kizomba Music\\nWhile the basic steps for kizomba always remain the same, you can vary your moves based on the type of music that\\'s playing. Retro/traditional kizomba: This style was invented in Angola in the 1950s and pairs with the traditional kizomba dance. It is based off of traditional Angolan music with heavy beats and sensuous rhythms to inspire fluid, purposeful movements. Semba: Semba is a music style that pairs the basic kizomba steps with more sensual music. One of the most important parts of dancing to this music is standing close enough to your partner that your chests or stomachs can touch throughout the song. Upbeat kizomba: This type of dance mixes the steps of kizomba with a faster, more electronic style of music. The steps are the same, but just slightly faster to keep up with the music! Zouk kizomba: Zouk is a Caribbean-style party music with a quick tempo and fun, syncopated beats. This style of kizomba has sharper movements, which require close coordination with your partner.\\n1. When you hear the first low, heavy drum beat in the song, take a step out to your left with your left foot for one beat. Then, bring your right foot to meet it on the next beat, and sway your hips as you dance to the music. Once your feet are together, you can step back to the right on the next beat, or shift to a forward or backward step. You may hear some instrumental music before the bass comes into the song.\\n2. Position your feet directly under your body, and make sure your spine is relaxed and straight as you look forward. Shift the toe of your left foot so that it’s pointing slightly outward on the left side of your body. This will help as you begin to take the first steps of the dance. If you’re dancing with a partner, face each other so that your legs are staggered.Tip: If you\\'re looking for a dance partner, don\\'t worry about finding someone of the opposite gender. Although there\\'s technically a \"leader\" and \"follower\" in kizomba dancing, those roles don\\'t have to be masculine or feminine.

Use double-sided paper that has color or patterns on both sides, and cut out circles, squares, or triangles.

You could create one long garland, or make several shorter ones for a layered effect. Choose colors that match your theme to keep everything looking cohesive. Cut out about 100 of each shape for a garland that’s 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1 m) long. To make this project easier, purchase a punch in the shape you want from your local craft store.

You could cut out squares, rectangles, triangles, or even differently-sized cards, depending on your taste. Use a pen or finely-tipped marker to write the name of a guest on each card. Card stock works well for this kind of project because it’s thicker and less likely to bend or crease. You can find lots of different colors of card stock at your local craft store. Put the place cards on top of each person’s plate, or make a cute place card holder, like these pine cone place cards.\\n4. You could make a collage out of different patterned and colored papers. You could replicate an image or photo you love by cutting out different shapes from different colored pieces of paper. You could even design something on the computer and then print it out and frame it. For a fun decoration, think of a quote you really love. Stencil it out onto white card stock and then cut it out.

The client's hair should be long enough to be combed straight back and have some height when blow-dried with a round-barrel brush. Depending on the exact size of their head, this should be at least 4 in (10 cm) long. Keep the texture of their hair in mind. Curly hair will straighten and lengthen a bit when you style it into a pomp. It would be even better if the hair on the sides of the client's head is already cut short. Something around 1 ⁄2 to 2 in (3.8 to 5.1 cm) long would be great! If your client’s hair is too long, do a rough cut by trimming it down to approximately 4 in (10 cm) on the top, and 2 in (5.1 cm) on the sides.\\n3. v4-460px-Cut-a-Pompadour-Step-6.jpg\\n4. Run the trimmers along the perimeter of the client’s hair, starting at one temple and finishing at the nape, then doing the same for the other side. Be sure to get the sideburns, behind the ears, and the bottom of the nape. Pull the ears away from the scalp so that you can reach behind them. Detail trimmers are a type of clipper with a narrow point that allows for precision. When doing the nape, hold the trimmers so that they are parallel to the hairline, then pull them away from the hairline. This will give you a crisp edge. For an old-school, rockabilly look, keep the sideburns long.\\n5. Make sure that you have trimmed off the bulk of the hair first using hair-cutting shears. Hold the comb with the teeth pointing up and angled away from the scalp. Comb it up through the hair until you've caught the hair that's just beneath the first side part. Run the clippers across the comb to trim the hair that's sticking out of it. Take the guard off of the clippers for this. The comb's teeth will keep the clippers from shaving too close. You can even do this with scissors instead! Start at one temple and work your way along the part until you reach the bottom of the V, then repeat the process for the back. This is the baseline. Make it about the same thickness as the comb, about 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm).\", 'question_id': 10417704, 'answer_choices': [[3, 2, 0, 4, 5, 1], [2, 0, 5, 1, 4, 3], [4, 1, 2, 3, 0, 5], [4, 2, 5, 3, 1, 0]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10417754.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Once you reach the 18-20 week ultrasound, it should be a lot easier to predict sex. The easiest way is to look for a penis. If you see one, there’s an excellent chance the sex is male. The absence of a penis indicates female. You might be able to identify a penis on your own, but it’s still a good idea to ask the technician if you’re looking at the right thing.

Creating a push-and-pull dynamic is one of the best ways to create sexual tension; you’ll show them you’re interested—but not too interested—then back off to keep them wanting more.

How to Work the Pull-and-Push\\nVerbally:“I keep thinking how sweet you look… but I’m not really sure I can trust you.”“You seem cool, but I don’t know if you’re ready to meet my friends.”“You’re giving it such a good try… maybe you’ll get it one of these times…”\\nPhysically:Lean into them or talk right in their ear, then slide away.Give them a light shove or punch on the arm, then rub it gently like you’re trying to make it better.\\n1. v4-460px-Create-Sexual-Tension-Step-4.jpg\\n2. When you first start talking to someone you’re interested in, start to establish touch early on by simply brushing up against them, or touching the back of their hand or shoulder. You can make it look like an accident at first, then get more purposeful when you start to get more comfortable with each other. If the person returns your interest, either by continuing the conversation or even touching you in return, get more purposeful. Try touching the small of their back or grabbing their arm or hand gently to escalate the tension. If you’re sure of their interest, try lightly grazing the side of their face. To make it more subtle, say something like, “I’ve got to get that hair out of your face, hold on… there you go.”\\n3. Confidence is one of the most attractive traits you can have, and exuding it can help ramp up sexual tension fast. If you don’t feel confident naturally, though, you can still fake it and reap the rewards. Take a relaxed stance. Lean on a table, keep your shoulders open, and cross your arms in a confident, almost cocky way. Smile and make eye contact, even if it feels too bold. Pretend that you’re someone else who’s more confident. Choose a celebrity, a friend, or even a stranger whose confidence you can feel. Act how you think they would until it feels natural. Repeat to yourself, “They’re attracted to me. They want me.” Even if you don’t fully believe it, putting the idea in your head gives you an instant, noticeable boost of confidence.\\n4. v4-460px-Create-Sexual-Tension-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Create-Sexual-Tension-Step-8.jpg\\n6. v4-460px-Create-Sexual-Tension-Step-2.jpg\\n7.

This method only works on young fossils as carbon decays quicker than other minerals. If no traces of carbon are found in a fossil, this indicates that it is older than 100,000 years. Use an accelerator mass spectrometer to measure the amount of carbon in the fossil. The amount of carbon in fossils decreases over time, therefore the lower the amount of carbon in a fossil, the older it is. Fossils need to be clean in order for carbon dating to be accurate. This method requires specialist equipment and is usually done by experts.\\n1. Volcanic rocks can be dated by measuring the amount of argon in them.

While the degreaser soaks in, a stiff bristled brush can help to remove the tougher bits of grime. Depending on the state of your engine bay, this step might take a good amount of elbow grease. Apply more degreaser as you scrub if need be. The metal you intend to paint must be completely free of grease and grime before you can move forward.\\n3. While it is easiest to paint the engine bay without the engine installed, that may not be an option for you. If so, park the vehicle where you intend to work on it the next day and leave it to cool for at least 8 hours. Applying cleaner to your engine while it's still hot can reduce how effective it can be. Working on an engine before it cools is dangerous because it will burn you.\\n4. v4-460px-Paint-an-Engine-Bay-Step-02.jpg\\n5. Be sure to wrap the engine's alternator and fuse box in particular. If your vehicle has an airbox around the air filter, you may still want to wrap plastic around it just to be safe. Covering things will help protect the engine while you clean it. The airbox is located at the end of the intake pipe that leads into the engine's intake manifold. If you have difficulty locating any of these parts, refer to your vehicle's owner's manual to locate them.

The dry air inside of the rotating metal drum causes static to build up between the fabrics as they rub together. Dryer sheets will also soften rough fabrics, so keep a box of them next to or on top of your dryer so you don’t forget to use one. When the load of laundry is done, just throw away the sheet as the effects are only good for 1 use. Dryer sheets are available in a variety of scents to match or compliment the soap you used to wash your clothes. If you are sensitive to flowery smells, there are even ones that are unscented. Static cling is more prevalent during the winter or on dry days when there is not a lot of humidity in the air. Make sure to use dryer sheets throughout the winter. If you used fabric softener while washing your clothes, then it is not necessary to use a dryer sheet as both remove static and soften the fabric.\\n1. v4-460px-Use-a-Clothes-Dryer-Step-2.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Use-a-Clothes-Dryer-Step-4.jpg\\n3. The spin cycle on the washing machine is used to remove excess water from the articles of clothing and linens. However, it also can compress and tangle the items. Before loading up the dryer, take a few moments to untangle and shake out the items. Items that are tangled in the dryer may not dry completely or at all. Lengthy items like sheets or large beach towels can get particularly tangled in the washing machine. Make sure that the items are separated and not twisted.\\n4. v4-460px-Use-a-Clothes-Dryer-Step-6.jpg\\n5. Delicate fabrics can be damaged over time if they rub against buttons or rough material like denim in the dryer. To extend the life of delicate garments, make some room in a closet to hang clothes to air-dry, or invest in a drying rack. Drying racks are great to lay out sweaters on during the winter months, and can be easily folded up and stored away when you are not using them. Local department stores near you should carry a variety of drying racks that will hold 1 or multiple garments. Delicate garments like bras, sweaters that might easily obtain pulls or become matted, and clothing made of silky or lace fabrics, should not be put in the dryer. The constant tumbling motion will degrade and damage the fabrics. Be careful with clothing items that are 100 percent cotton as they will shrink during the first few times you put them in the dryer. Even items that are partly cotton may have some shrinkage over time.

Natto is relatively inexpensive to buy, and can be purchased for as little as $0.89 USD (0.77 Euro) or as much as $3.00 USD (2.58 Euro). It is typically offered in small, round single packs, or bundled into 3 medium, square packages. Natto is a refrigerated item and can spoil. Make sure to check the expiration date before purchasing.\\n1. v4-459px-Eat-Natto-Step-4.jpg\\n2. The natto will be hard to stir at first, but will eventually soften and loosen. Don't be alarmed if the mixture begins to turn white or develop bubbles, as this is normal for the natto as it aerates. Stop mixing the natto when you have reached a consistency you are satisfied with. Most recommendations are to stir the natto in one direction to avoid spilling it, and to stir it for at least 50 turns or 60 seconds.\\n3. v4-459px-Eat-Natto-Step-2.jpg\\n4.

Set your secondary fermenter on the ground or a low shelf 2–3 feet (0.61–0.91 m) below your primary fermenter. Insert one end of an auto-siphon into the primary fermenter so that it sits just over the bottom of the container, then place the opposite end into the secondary fermenter and pump the siphon a couple times to get the flow started. After a few seconds, gravity will cause the beer to drain out of the higher fermenter and into the lower one. Squeeze the hose clamp on the auto-siphon to control how fast the liquid flows through the hose. Be sure to run some sanitizer solution through your auto-siphon before and after the transition to avoid contaminating or throwing off the flavor of the beer.\\n2. A week’s worth of steeping will give the hops a chance to impart their full flavor to the beer. During this time, avoid opening the secondary fermenter for any reason. It needs to stay sealed in order for the oxygen and carbon dioxide in the beer to stay balanced. Avoid leaving the hops to steep for longer than 2-3 weeks.

Exhale slowly as you pull your stomach muscles inward and hold until you are ready to inhale again. Then, relax your muscles. It’s super important that you let out the air through your mouth instead of your nose, since this gives you more control over your breathing. Exhale slowly until there isn’t any air left in your body. It may help you to try to exhale all of the air in roughly 3-5 seconds as well, helping time your breathing. You're able to get rid of more air in your body by exhaling through your mouth. You may also want to add a pelvic floor lift as you contract your abdominal muscles.\\n2. There are lots of ways you can position yourself for this exercise, but standing up straight is a simple way to begin.

If you’re just learning this exercise, you may only be able to hold it for 5-10 seconds. It is important to continue breathing normally during the exercise, so don’t hold your breath. Practicing this exercise regularly will help you increase the amount of time you can hold in your breath and stomach, eventually reaching as long as 60 seconds. Some people hold their breath the entire time they’re holding the position, while others try to breathe normally. Do not relax your stomach muscles.\\n5. People with more experience doing this exercise may do it 10 times before stopping, but start off with 5 times.

If your partner is leaning forward and touching you, it’s likely that they want to keep kissing you. In that case, you can give them a longer kiss, opening your mouth slightly. However, if they are pulling back, are not moving, or are very stiff and uncomfortable, they may not be interested, and you should break off the kiss. It’s usually better to keep kisses lighter the first time. Since this is the other person’s first kiss, they may become overwhelmed if it’s too intense. Keep your kiss soft and light, and avoid using your tongue unless they do it first. Both you and your partner should be kissing each other with the same amount of pressure.

If you work full-time for any week while getting benefits you will no longer be eligible to receive benefits for that week. If you earn more than 1/3rd of the amount of your weekly benefit while working part-time, your weekly benefit amount will be deducted dollar-for-dollar. Earning over 1/3rd the amount of your benefits is also known as your earning disregard. To calculate your earnings disregard, divide the amount of your weekly benefit by 3 or 1/3. If the amount you make working part-time is over that number, then subtract 1/3 of your benefits from your part-time wages. This number will be how much your weekly benefits will be reduced while you continue to work part-time. Full-time is considered between 35 and 40 hours of work in 1 week. If you work full-time any week you will lose your eligibility regardless of how much you were paid for that week.\\n3. You are eligible to receive unemployment benefits if you were laid off due to reduction-in-force or if you were let go because your employer had to make cuts due to economic hardship. You are not eligible to receive unemployment benefits if you quit your job. However, if you quit due to a dangerous work environment, discrimination by your employer, or misconduct by another employee or employer, you may still be eligible to receive benefits. If you were let go because you failed to perform the duties of your job, were fired due to intentional misconduct, or violated a reasonable or regularly enforced rule, then you may not be eligible for benefits. If the rule you violated was due to incompetence, you may still be eligible. If you were forced to leave your job because of an urgent situation such as domestic violence or other critical personal issues, you are still eligible to receive unemployment benefits. You will not qualify if you have ever been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor.\\n4. v4-460px-File-for-Unemployment-in-Massachusetts-Step-4.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-File-for-Unemployment-in-Massachusetts-Step-6.jpg\\n6. To remain eligible while you receive unemployment benefits, you must be actively seeking employment. The state of Massachusetts requires you to make 3 work search attempts every week while receiving unemployment status. You have completed a work search attempt once you have applied for a job opening. Often, you must register with MassHire, a career center provided by the state. This is where you will conduct your work search. You may also be required to attend career seminars to maintain your eligibility. To register or for more information on MassHire visit https://www.mass.gov/masshire-career-centers. You must log all of your work search attempts. The job search log is located at https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2018/08/08/Work%20Search%20Form%2008-08-18.pdf.

Amaretto is often drunk on its own, or you can add it to club soda or even orange juice. Generally, you will add 1 jigger of liqueur to 8 ounces (230 g) of a mixer. Depending on the brand you buy, it may be a little sweeter or a little spicier, per that manufacturer’s recipe. Amaretto is also often used in baking to flavor cookies or cakes.\\n1. v4-460px-Drink-Liqueur-Step-6.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Drink-Liqueur-Step-4.jpg\\n3. Triple Sec is a popular ingredient in margaritas, but it can be added to a lot of other cocktails, too. Long Island iced tea, Cosmos, and Sidecars all feature Triple Sec. You can also drink it neat if you like sweeter, citrusy flavors. Triple Sec and Cointreau are very similar, but their flavors are slightly different. Triple Sec is traditionally a little sweeter, while Cointreau plays with bitter notes as well.\\n4. Kahlua is most famously used for White Russian cocktails, but you can also drink it on the rocks or use it in a lot of other drink recipes. While it’s consumed all-year long, around the holidays, it really picks up in popularity. Kahlua also comes in specialty flavors, like pumpkin spice and french vanilla.\\n5. v4-460px-Drink-Liqueur-Step-2.jpg\\n6. v4-460px-Drink-Liqueur-Step-8.jpg\\n7. St-Germain is frequently paired with gins and champagnes, as it is light and floral. The elderflower complements those lighter alcohols really nicely.

The great thing about self-adhesive or contact paper is that it comes in a variety of designs and can be found at any craft store. Matte, gloss, and vinyl are the most reasonably priced, while marble and granite paper seem to run on the expensive side. If you are looking for a more sophisticated look, try using black and white floral prints. For fun and edgy looks, use translucent paper or animal prints. Choose red paper as a decoration for the holidays or floral patterns to represent different seasons. This is also a great option for improving the appearance of your doors if you live in a rental property.

Finally, add a long, skinny lemon peel to the cocktail and then top the whole thing off with 4 fluid ounces (120 mL) of sparkling wine. Make sure you add the lemon peel before you add the sparkling wine, as pouring in the wine without the lemon peel already in the cocktail will cause it to bubble up too fast. You can also add a brandied cherry to the drink as a final garnish. You may see this drink referred to as a “Sambuca 75,” as it’s a variation of an established cocktail known as the “French 75.”\\n4. Pour ice into a mixing glass and add 2 fluid ounces (59 mL) of overproof bourbon whiskey and 1 fluid ounce (30 mL) of sambuca. Then add 4 dashes of bitters and stir the ingredients together. Finally, use a strainer to strain the cocktail into a small rocks glass with ice. Add 2 twists of lemon peel to the top of the drink for a zesty garnish.

They not only smell great, but they are great for your skin. Scrubs can be used on your face, arms, and legs to exfoliate away dead skin cells. Body butters can be used all over your body just after a shower to lock in moisture. This will help your skin feel soft and smooth. You can find these at beauty supply shops, but you can make them as well with simple ingredients, such as sugar and olive oil. Avoid using body butters on your face. Use facial moisturizing creams instead. You can use some sugar scrubs on your face, but they must be labeled for facial use. If you are making the scrub yourself, be sure to use brown sugar.\\n2. Toner will help seal your pores and restore your skin's pH. Moisturizer will not only help make your skin soft and smooth, but will also prevent your skin from looking flaky when you put makeup on. Use a lighter moisturizer with SPF in the morning, and a heavier one in the evening. Use a heavier moisturizer in the winter when your skin is more dry, and a lighter one in the summer when your skin is more oily. If you have oily skin, choose a lightweight, gel-based moisturizer intended for oily skin. If you have sensitive skin, try one without any added fragrances.\\n3. Wearing makeup is a great way to make your natural features shine and stand out. It can also help you feel good about yourself. Unfortunately, it can also clog your pores and potentially lead to acne. If you wear makeup on a daily basis, try to go makeup free every so often to give your skin a chance to breathe. A good day to go without makeup is when you are chilling at home over the weekend.\\n4. v4-460px-Look-Beautiful-As-a-Teenage-Girl-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Look-Beautiful-As-a-Teenage-Girl-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n6. To keep your skin looking its best, you should wash your face in the morning when you get up, and in the evening before you go to bed. Use a facial cleanser (not regular soap) and gentle, circular motions. Never scrub your skin, as this can damage it. When you are done, splash your face with cold water. This will help tighten and minimize your pores. Avoid using hot water, as this can cause your skin to become dry. Focus on the areas that tend to get the most oily and dirty, such as your nose, forehead, neck, and chin. Always remove your makeup before you go to bed, no matter how tired you are. Leaving makeup on will lead to clogged pores and pimples.\\n7. v4-460px-Look-Beautiful-As-a-Teenage-Girl-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\\n8. If you cannot afford to go to a dermatologist, look for products that contain benzoyl peroxide. Use these products sparingly at night before you go to bed.

A strong online wallet has an active development team, robust backup and security features, and is compatible with multiple operating systems. The wallet also should allow you to maintain control of your private keys. Anyone who has access to your private keys can move your cryptocurrency. Avoid online wallets that require you to give up control of your private key. Cryptocurrency wallets are not banks, and are not subject to the same regulations. If the wallet company loses your cryptocurrency, you may have no recourse. You may also want to look into the background of people handling security for the wallet company.

Multi-signature wallets require more than one person to enter a separate passcode or phrase to enable a transaction. This provides the ultimate in security, but should only be used if there is someone you trust with access to your cryptocurrency. For example, if you are married, both you and your spouse could be signatories on a multi-signature wallet. You would both have to enter your separate passcode before either of you could complete a transaction. Multi-signature wallets also are ideal for businesses that have cryptocurrency wallets. At least 2 officers or managers in the company would have to sign off on a transaction before it could be completed, helping prevent embezzlement of company funds.\\n3. v4-459px-Keep-Your-Cryptocurrency-Safe-Step-2.jpg\\n4. When you buy cryptocurrency, you have the option of simply leaving it in your exchange account. However, cryptocurrency exchanges are major targets for hackers. Any cryptocurrency left in an exchange account is extremely vulnerable to theft. While exchange accounts may be the most convenient, they are also the least secure. With cryptocurrency, the basic rule is that the more convenient it is to access your cryptocurrency, the less secure it is. Generally, your cryptocurrency should be okay if you leave it in your exchange account for a few days.

Timing and tone are everything when it comes to apologizing. Apologies cannot occur too quick after the incident, or too delayed. She may not be ready to hear you say, “I’m sorry” because she may view it as insincere and designed to quickly sweep your actions under the rug. Assessing if she is ready to hear it. If you wait too long you may sense additional hostility or possibly a lot of silence. You don’t want to be perceived as unapologetic, and forgetting or avoiding making an apology will never win you points. You are the one that has to earn her trust, not the other way around. You’re right. It isn’t an even playing field, but you can earn that balance back with effort and time. Put your ego aside and work harder than you ever have. It will be worth it to repair the damage to the relationship with your friend, loved one, or work colleague. If you are texting or e-mailing an apology remember that your tone may come across as one-dimensional. Use additional words surrounding the “I’m sorry” for example, “I wish you could hear my voice tell you I’m sorry. You would hear that I am so sad and upset that I’ve caused things to go the way that they have. I know saying sorry isn’t enough, but please know that I am truly sorry. I would really like to know if you will accept my apology.” Awaiting the response will be hard, but once you get it you will know what to do next.\\n4. You need to be able to read the signs. If you feel like you have done your due diligence and the person is not cooperating, then it may be time to move on. You may feel extremely desperate, and may even beg the person.

Just because you want to rebuild trust with someone doesn’t mean she wants to participate. You must respect a person’s boundaries. It doesn’t necessarily mean that you will never have the chance, just not at the present. Test the waters before you start any process that involves another person. It takes two willing participants. You can say things like, “I know this is a difficult thing to talk about, but I’d really like to ask you if you would be willing to let me earn back your trust. I understand if it is too soon, or if you don’t ever want to see that happen.

You want free airflow around the bundle and you want it to be out of direct sunlight, which could dry the thyme too quickly. The temperature around the thyme should be at least 50 °F (10 °C). This temperature will ensure that the thyme dries at a steady rate. It’s best to have the thyme in a spot with low humidity, so that mold doesn’t develop on it. Check the thyme for mold after the first few days of drying. Throw it out if you see any on the sprigs.

It may be boring, but simply repeating new information over and over in different ways will help it stick in your brain better, especially if you space out the repetition over time. For example, if you’re trying to remember the definition of a new word, read it several times to yourself. Then speak the definition out loud a couple times, and try writing it down once or twice. It helps to repeat the information over a spaced-out period of time.

If you can link new ideas with previously established ones, then you can increase the chance that new memories will be formed. Try coming up with a familiar picture, song, joke, or rhyme that you can associate with the new material. Form a picture in your mind that includes the new fact. For example, if you’re meeting someone named Peggy, picture them with a pirate hat, eye patch, and peg leg. Try making an acronym or acrostic to learn multiple pieces of information in order. Invent a sentence where the first letter of each word stands for a word you’re trying to remember. A popular example is used by music students learning the order of notes on a treble clef staff, where the phrase “Every Good Boy Does Fine” represents the notes “EGBDF.”\\nCome up with a rhyme that contains the information you need to remember. For example, “In fourteen hundred and ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.”\\nIt’s helpful to come up with an association early on, when you’re first learning the information. The more associations you can create, the more likely it is that the new fact will stick in your memory.\\n2. v4-460px-Improve-Long-Term-Memory-Step-8.jpg\\n3. Simply re-reading the same information isn’t good enough - you have to actually practice retrieving the information from your memory in order to strengthen the connections within your brain. If you’re working out of a textbook with quizzes at the end of each chapter, go through and answer several of the questions. You can also try asking yourself questions about the material, and looking up the answers you come up with in order to double-check yourself. Many people don’t like tests because they feel frustrated when they realize they’ve forgotten something they’ve just tried to learn, but going through the process of forgetting and re-learning new things helps better cement memories in your mind. Be sure to immediately check your answers to make sure you’ve gotten them right. If you answer something wrong, you will be more likely to remember it incorrectly in the future as well, so immediately correct yourself and repeat the right answer a few more times.\\n4. v4-460px-Improve-Long-Term-Memory-Step-10.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Improve-Long-Term-Memory-Step-6.jpg', 'question_id': 10429284, 'answer_choices': [[2, 5, 3, 0, 4, 1], [1, 5, 0, 2, 3, 4], [2, 0, 4, 3, 5, 1], [4, 0, 5, 2, 1, 3]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10430903.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Dye-Clothing-Black-Without-Dye-Step-12.jpg\\n1. Hang the fabric in a sunny spot outside or lay it over a drying rack in the laundry room. This gives the dye a chance to set before you wash it. Place an old sheet or a drop cloth underneath the fabric as it dries to collect any drips of dye. They will stain any carpet or nearby fabric.\\n2. You may need to lower the heat to maintain a steady simmer. Stir the fabric in the pot occasionally to make sure it’s getting evenly coated. If you’re dyeing wool, avoid stirring it too much or you’ll cause it to felt.\\n3. Use items with iron that rust easily like nails, screws, steel wool, or bolts. The more rust on the objects, the more effective your dye will be. If you don’t have a glass jar, use any other large glass container with a lid. You can buy iron powder from an online retailer if you don’t have rusty objects. Simply mix the powder into the vinegar. Making Your Own Rusted Nails\\nPlace your nails in a container or bowl and soak them in white vinegar for 5 minutes. Drain the vinegar, then pour hydrogen peroxide over the nails. For extra rust, sprinkle some sea salt into the mixture, too. Remove the nails from the liquid and let them air dry. You'll notice them start rusting immediately!\\n4. v4-460px-Dye-Clothing-Black-Without-Dye-Step-6.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Dye-Clothing-Black-Without-Dye-Step-10.jpg\\n6. v4-460px-Dye-Clothing-Black-Without-Dye-Step-2.jpg\\n7. Place the pot over low to medium heat, stirring the acorns occasionally. This cooking process helps extract the natural color from the nuts. A simmer often occurs between 195 and 211 °F (91 and 99 °C) and has tinier, slower bubbles than a rolling boil.\\n8. v4-460px-Dye-Clothing-Black-Without-Dye-Step-8.jpg\\n9. v4-460px-Dye-Clothing-Black-Without-Dye-Step-4.jpg\\n10. Gently swish the fabric around in the pot with a large spoon to make sure it’s evenly coated. The reaction between the iron and the dye is what darkens and sets the color. Use a stainless steel spoon to stir the fabric. A wooden spoon will be permanently stained by the dye.\\n11. An area that gets direct sunlight and is very warm will work best. The water and vinegar mixture should turn a copper shade due to the reaction between the iron from the rust and the vinegar. Good places for your jar include a deck, driveway, or windowsill.

Synthetic desiccant packets are those ⁄4 in (1.9 cm) packets that come in various commercial items including shoe boxes, dried foods (like beef jerky or spices), and electronic devices. The packets are typically filled with highly absorptive silica beads which will pull moisture out of your phone. You do not need to tear open the packets. Simply pile them up on top of your phone and let them pull the moisture out. This option will only work if you’ve been saving up silica gel packets in advance for several months. However, this isn’t a bad idea: many people own smartphones, and the chances of dropping your smartphone in water at some point are high. Or, if you haven’t been saving up silica gel packets, you can order them in bulk through major online retailers.\\n2. Crystal cat litter is made of silica gel. This material is extremely absorptive and will do an excellent job of pulling residual moisture out of a water-damaged phone. You can purchase crystal cat litter at any large grocery store or pet-supply shop. Do not use any other type of cat litter.

If you were successful, the engine will start as the engine is turned by the wheels. This will also power the alternator, which will produce enough current to keep the engine running. Pressing the clutch back in will allow the engine to idle. The engine should continue to run thanks to the current produced by the alternator, which is also charging the battery.\\n2. v4-460px-Jump-a-Car-Without-Cables-Step-8.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Jump-a-Car-Without-Cables-Step-4.jpg\\n4. Depending on how dead the battery was, it may take the alternator some time to recharge it enough to be able to start the engine again on its own. Drive it around or just leave it running where it’s parked to give the alternator time to charge the battery. Be sure you park the vehicle in a safe place to let it charge. The side of the road is generally not considered a safe parking space. You can drive the vehicle like normal once it’s running.\\n5. As the engine starts, torque steer may move the wheels to the left or right if you don’t prevent it with proper control. There’s no need to keep a white-knuckle grip on the wheel, but hold it as firmly as you normally do while driving. The wheel may jerk a bit suddenly as the engine is engaged, but then should feel normal.\\n6. Plant your foot firmly on the brake while you disengage the parking brake and use your left foot to hold the clutch pedal to the floor. Make sure you hold the brake pedal down while releasing the parking brake so the vehicle doesn’t start to roll prematurely. Keep the clutch pedal pressed firmly on the floor.\\n7. Push starting your car on a hill may help get the vehicle moving, but can also be dangerous. If your car is parked on a steep hill, it is unsafe to push start it and you’ll have to call a tow truck or friend with jumper cables to assist you. If it’s on a slight hill, however, the incline may help get the car rolling. If your on a hill with any more than a slight grade, it may be unsafe to try to push start your car. Push starting a car on a steep hill runs the risk rolling down the hill without power steering or power brakes.\\n8. With the battery dead, the car won’t do anything when you turn the key, but it will release the steering wheel lock. It’s also important that the key is in the “on” position when push starting the vehicle, otherwise the engine won’t start. If you turn the key and hear a rapid clicking from the starter don’t worry. That just means there’s some electricity in the system, but not enough to turn the motor over.\\n9. v4-460px-Jump-a-Car-Without-Cables-Step-6.jpg\\n10. If you’re on a hill, getting going will be easy, but if your friends are pushing, it may take a second to get the wheels turning. Keep the clutch pressed as the vehicle builds up speed to at least 5 miles (8.0 km) per hour, but preferably closer to 10 miles (16 km) per hour. The faster you are going, the more likely the engine will start when you release the clutch. If the car starts rolling downhill faster than your friends can keep up, tell them not to run to catch up, but instead just let the car roll.\\n11. v4-460px-Jump-a-Car-Without-Cables-Step-12.jpg\\n12. v4-460px-Jump-a-Car-Without-Cables-Step-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10431904, 'answer_choices': [[4, 7, 10, 11, 5, 9, 6, 12, 0, 8, 1, 2, 3], [7, 12, 8, 3, 6, 9, 10, 2, 5, 0, 1, 11, 4], [2, 7, 10, 4, 8, 11, 6, 1, 5, 3, 0, 12, 9], [2, 1, 3, 7, 10, 12, 4, 0, 9, 5, 8, 11, 6]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10431936.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Start-Eating-Clean-Step-2.jpg\\n1. The basis of a clean eating plan should be whole, unprocessed fruits and vegetables. Try to buy fresh fruits and vegetables whenever possible. Include 1 or 2 servings of veggies or fruit with every meal. If you don’t like to wash and cut produce yourself, you can purchase pre-washed and cut fresh produce. Frozen produce is also a good option because it is minimally processed. It may even be higher in nutrients than some fresh produce.

Fight the urge to withdraw from your social circle because you don’t feel well. When someone in your circle asks how they can help, be specific as to what you need. Ask them to go to the store for you, tidy up a bit, or just be a sympathetic ear while you vent your emotions.\\n1. v4-460px-Ease-Cymbalta-Withdrawal-Symptoms-Step-8.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Ease-Cymbalta-Withdrawal-Symptoms-Step-6.jpg\\n3. Especially if you’ve been taking Cymbalta for depression, it’s quite possible that you already attend therapy sessions with a mental health professional. If so, make sure you keep going to sessions as you taper off the medication. If not, ask your prescribing physician and your insurer for recommendations on qualified therapists in your area.

Mix 1 part high-proof alcohol with 3 parts Lugol’s solution. You only need a tiny amount of solution per cell, so you don't need to mix that much. Use an eyedropper to apply 1 to 2 drops of the solution over the side of the square with the titanium coating. Look for Lugol’s solution online, at health stores, and at aquarium suppliers. The alcohol and Lugol's solution create an electrolyte that carries and transfers the electrical charge generated by the titanium dioxide.\\n2. Combine 0.5 grams of nanopowder with enough alcohol to create a mixture that’s about as thick as toothpaste. Use a high-proof spirit, such as 40-proof or higher vodka or grain alcohol. Then mix in a drop of clear dish soap, which will help the paste adhere to your conductive glass. High-proof alcohol is needed to crystallize the titanium dioxide so it can absorb solar energy. Sunlight excites electrons in the crystallized titanium, which generates electricity. You can purchase titanium dioxide nanopowder online; 0.5 grams is enough to create several solar cells.Variation: Use 10 to 12 mini or 6 full-size white powdered doughnuts to make your own titanium dioxide. Scrape off the powder, stir it into a glass of warm water, then pour the water through a coffee filter. Transfer the residue left in the filter to an oven-safe pan, then purify it in a 500 °F (260 °C) oven for 2 hours.\\n3. v4-460px-Make-a-Small-Solar-Panel-Step-2.jpg\\n4. You should now have a functioning solar cell! Set the cell in sunlight, then use alligator clips to connect a multimeter’s sensors to both flat, square sides (front and back) of the cell. You should find your cell generates a modest electrical current. Building a small, DIY solar cell is a great way to improve your understanding of how solar technology works. However, if you want a functional solar panel, your best option is to create one using store-bought solar cells.\\n5. v4-460px-Make-a-Small-Solar-Panel-Step-6.jpg\\n6. v4-460px-Make-a-Small-Solar-Panel-Step-4.jpg\\n7. Carefully remove the tape after coating the glass. Place the square on a hot plate set to high, and cook it until the coating browns then turns white again, or for 10 to 20 minutes. When it’s white again, turn off the burner and allow the square to cool for at least 20 to 30 minutes. Watch the coating as it cooks, as it’ll look about the same at the beginning and end of the cooking process. The browning stage burns off the alcohol and dish soap, leaving behind a pure, dry layer of titanium dioxide. If you don’t have a hot plate, you could also heat the square on the burner of an electric stove.\\n8. To create a counter-electrode, cover the conductive side of a second 10 by 10 cm (3.9 by 3.9 in) glass square with graphite. An ordinary pencil will do the trick. Color the center of the square, and leave a 2 to 3 mm (0.079 to 0.118 in) perimeter around the edges. You can also hold the center of the square’s conductive side over a candle until soot forms. Repeatedly pass it over the flame, then wipe off any soot around the edges with a clean, dry cotton swab. The cell won’t generate a current without the graphite or soot counter-electrode.\", 'question_id': 10435763, 'answer_choices': [[4, 6, 7, 0, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1], [4, 7, 2, 6, 1, 5, 8, 0, 3], [2, 3, 7, 6, 8, 5, 1, 0, 4], [7, 1, 3, 0, 4, 8, 6, 5, 2]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/104357.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. The world today is fast and impatient, but being a better person involves taking the time to work on your values. Decide what values and virtues are most important to you. Create a personal system of morals by joining clubs and organizations that will help you build your virtues, like a sports team, community service clubs, choir, or student government. Empathy, honesty, patience, humor, and perseverance are just a few examples of good values. Consider some clubs and activities that might help you develop values. For instance, joining a sports team can help you practice perseverance. Joining student government can help you develop dependability, and doing community service can help you cultivate empathy and generosity. Think about how you can put those qualities into practice throughout the school day. For example, if you think generosity is a good value, then find a way to really brighten someone’s day by sharing something that belongs to you.\\n1. Work on your school work over time. Do your homework and study a little every day, rather than cram the night before the big test. Don't procrastinate on a big project, especially if it's a big portion of your final grade. You'll be less overwhelmed with your schoolwork in the long run, and will have time to deal with unexpected problems with the material you might face. If you have any trouble understanding something, never hesitate to get extra help. Ask your teacher to spend a little more time covering the material with you. See if your school offers peer tutoring services.\\n2. Wear clothes and accessories that represent you and make you feel good. Know your own likes and dislikes, and express who you are. Dress for success: wear what not only makes you comfortable, but what makes you feel happy and ready to put your best foot forward. It doesn't need to be expensive, trendy, or flashy: you style should just make you feel confident and happy. Don't pretend to like something to get someone's attention. People being around will appreciate your different interests and want to get to know you better.\\n3. v4-460px-Be-a-Better-Person-at-School-Step-4.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Be-a-Better-Person-at-School-Step-2.jpg\", 'question_id': 104357, 'answer_choices': [[0, 2, 4, 3, 1], [0, 4, 1, 3, 2], [4, 3, 0, 1, 2], [1, 4, 3, 0, 2]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1043662.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. From a business perspective, the sex of the unborn foal can have many implications. Commonly, the sex can influence whether to keep or sell your mare. For example, you may decide to keep the mare if she is having a filly (female), or sell if her she is having a colt (male). Some horse owners may also consider selling a mare’s weanling based on the sex of her unborn foal. The sex of the unborn foal can also influence decisions concerning appraisal and insurance coverage. Horse owners may want a filly or colt by a particular sire. For example, if a mare is pregnant with a filly by a particular sire, but the owner wants a colt, the owner may want to breed their mare to the same sire again to try for a colt. Discuss the potential options with your veterinarian. You should decide what is best for you, whether it is from a business or personal perspective.\\n1. It is very important to understand that ultrasonography will only determine the unborn foal’s sex. It should  not  be used to control the sex. In other words, if the unborn foal’s sex is not what you desire, you should not terminate the pregnancy and quickly re-breed your mare to try to obtain the desired sex. Keep in mind that, by the time the unborn foal’s sex can be accurately determined by ultrasound, your mare will be too far into her gestation to re-breed her in time to have a normal foaling date the following year.\\n2. v4-460px-Tell-the-Gender-of-a-Mare%27s-Unborn-Foal-Step-2-Version-2.jpg', 'question_id': 1043662, 'answer_choices': [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [2, 1, 0], [0, 2, 1]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10436633.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Crochet-Letters-on-a-Blanket-Step-02-Version-2.jpg\\n1.

Ask your partner if he has a free evening in the next few weeks. Tell him that you would like to have him over for dinner. Try to choose a night where you will have the house to yourself.

Since you're probably going to be washing dishes, opening the refrigerator, and looking in the mirror every day, use those opportunities to practice your Spanish. Write the name of the item in Spanish on a sticky note, place it on the item, and practice saying the words when you see them. To take this a step further, write a full sentence in Spanish on the note. For example, on your bathroom mirror, you could write, “Estoy cepillando los dientes.” This means “I'm brushing my teeth.”\\nOn your refrigerator, you could write, “Tengo hambre” for “I'm hungry,” or “Estoy abriendo el refrigerador” for “I'm opening the refrigerator.”\\n1. Practicing having conversations in Spanish is the most important component of learning to speak comfortably. No matter how much you read, write, and study, the only way to learn to have conversations is through practice with real people. Fortunately, there are many ways to practice your skills with others:\\nSearch for opportunities to meet people in your area, such as a Spanish conversation group—websites like Meetup and Couchsurfing can be great for this. Find native Spanish speakers to chat with online via sites like Italki. Try a language exchange, where you will be paired with a native Spanish speaker who wants to learn your language. This is a wonderful way to make new friends and expand your understanding of other cultures.\\n2. Listening to Spanish music, looking up the lyrics, and singing along is a fun way to practice your speaking and pronunciation. The themes and emotions conveyed in music are universal, so bringing Spanish music into your life will help you feel connected to the culture and motivate you to keep learning. Listening to Spanish songs can also introduce you to idioms and more colloquial language that is used in different Spanish-speaking countries.\\n3. Watching movies in Spanish is a great way to get excited about the language. Do an internet search to find some classic, popular Spanish films to watch with subtitles in either your native language or in Spanish. Whether to use Spanish subtitles or your native language's subtitles depends on your skill level. If you are an absolute beginner, watch the movie in your native language with Spanish subtitles, or in Spanish with subtitles in your native language. If you know how to read Spanish but are struggling with your listening skills, try watching the movie with Spanish subtitles. Learning through watching movies in Spanish can be more effective when you have learned some basic Spanish vocabulary already.\\n4. v4-460px-Tie-in-Learning-Spanish-to-Your-Interests-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n5. Going to school doesn't fall into everyone's interest category, but if you are someone who loves to learn in a formal capacity and get feedback, try taking a class at a local college or language institute. A quick search on the internet will provide you with an abundance of options for classes to take, either online or in person. Choose a class that has “immersion” or “conversation” in the title. An immersion class means that the teacher speaks in the language that you're learning. Conversation classes will focus on practicing conversation skills with others in Spanish. Hiring a tutor is another option to consider for more one-on-one practice. Websites such as Verbling offer online conversational classes and lessons. Your local library may offer free or low-cost classes, if price is an issue.\\n6. v4-460px-Tie-in-Learning-Spanish-to-Your-Interests-Step-10.jpg\\n7. v4-460px-Tie-in-Learning-Spanish-to-Your-Interests-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n8. v4-460px-Tie-in-Learning-Spanish-to-Your-Interests-Step-8.jpg\\n9. v4-460px-Tie-in-Learning-Spanish-to-Your-Interests-Step-6.jpg\", 'question_id': 1043706, 'answer_choices': [[2, 0, 6, 3, 9, 1, 7, 4, 8, 5], [1, 6, 7, 4, 5, 2, 9, 3, 0, 8], [3, 4, 0, 7, 5, 9, 2, 8, 1, 6], [9, 0, 7, 3, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1, 5]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1043727.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

Wheat bran or oatmeal will work well for this purpose. Use just enough to cover the bottom of the container. The substrate will serve as both bedding and a source of nourishment for the superworm larvae. There’s no need to put any additional food in the containers for the superworm larvae. Some breeders recommend against using substrate altogether, since any source of food can slow down the pupating process. If you choose to leave out the substrate, make sure the larvae are already full size (about 2 inches (51 mm) long) before isolating them.\\n2. Peek in on your superworm larvae occasionally over the next week to 10 days. After a few days, you should notice that most of your superworms have curled up into a “c” or “e” shape. By the end of a week or so, they should begin to transform into “alien”-looking pupae, with a shorter, cream-colored body and ridges that will eventually become legs. Any larvae that are stiff and straight or have turned dark in color are probably dead. Discard any dead larvae and replace them with live ones.\\n3.

Although this is a matter of some debate, many people choose to pour a little bit of water into their single malt whiskey to dilute it. This makes the drink less sharp and allows them to experience the whiskey’s more subtle flavors. Add a few drops of water to your drink to see if you like it more. Most people who support adding water to whiskey would encourage you to add your water in small increments and to taste; there’s no set amount of water that you should add to your drink.

Nosing whiskey is the act smelling your whiskey while it’s in the glass to appreciate its flavor and aroma before drinking it. In contrast to sniffing wine, you should smell the whiskey in small, sharp sniffs and keep your mouth open as you sniff it to avoid overwhelming and “burning” your nose. If sniffing the whiskey starts to become unpleasant, take a break and sniff the back of your hand; this will “reset” your nose and allow you to comfortably smell the whiskey again.

Grate raw turmeric and sprinkle it over prepared lentils, rice, or grains. Then stir the turmeric in until it's completely combined. The turmeric will add great flavor to otherwise bland grains. For example, add 1/2 teaspoon of grated turmeric into the water for 1 cup (175 g) of dried rice. Keep in mind that the turmeric will greatly change the color of the grains.

Catching a guy’s eyes can come across as interest or a desire to talk, so you can give off the opposite vibe by avoiding eye contact as much as you can. If you don’t want to make it obvious, you can glance at him when he addresses you, but look away again as soon as you can. For the most effective ignoring technique, act like he doesn’t exist and try not to even look in his direction. If you’re interested in him, you can take quick glances out of the corners of your eyes to see what he’s doing or whether he’s looking at you.\\n1. One of the most effective ways to ignore a guy is to simply act completely normal when he’s around. Continue doing whatever you doing before he walked in the room, keeping busy to show him that you aren’t affected by his presence at all. Talk to your friends, bend over your desk and work, or focus on your food if you’re eating. Return your focus to whatever you’re doing to show that you don’t notice him.\\n2. v4-460px-Ignore-a-Guy-Step-4.jpg\\n3. If he enters a room, casually move to the opposite corner. If you know he likes to eat lunch in a certain spot, or sits in a particular place at school or work, go there as little as possible. Keeping your distance prevents you from coming into direct contact, which makes it easy to ignore him. Don’t make it too obvious. Immediately turning around and walking away the moment you see him shows that you notice his presence, and are affected by it. Instead, continue your work or conversation, then use an excuse to move away, such as talking to another person or throwing something in the trash.\\n4. v4-460px-Ignore-a-Guy-Step-2.jpg', 'question_id': 10439895, 'answer_choices': [[3, 2, 4, 1, 0], [0, 4, 3, 2, 1], [1, 0, 3, 2, 4], [3, 2, 1, 4, 0]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10439942.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

If you don’t have much structure to your mornings, make a plan to change that. Having a good morning routine can help you to wake up feeling like you have a direction and purpose. If your morning routine has not been working out for you, make a plan to change the way you wake up and start your day.\\n1. Proper hydration is important for your body to function well. Drinking water helps with digestion, metabolism, skin and muscle health, and kidney function. After a night of sleeping and perspiring, your body needs to be rehydrated. Drink a glass of water as part of your morning routine and fill a water bottle to bring with you when you head to work or school. Choose water instead of juice, soda, or other sugary beverages.\\n2. Getting up and hopping in the shower first thing in the morning can help you to feel more alert, but it can also help start your day on a more relaxing and pleasant note. Use body wash and other products that smell nice and allow yourself plenty of time for a luxurious shower. Make your morning shower even more enjoyable by listening to your favorite music and singing along. Research has shown that our brains release dopamine when we listen to music and oxytocin when we sing. These chemicals reduce stress, increase feelings of happiness, and help keep us mentally and physically healthy. Combining music and singing while you shower will provide some great benefits for your brain and body at the beginning of your day.<\\nTry adding a cold blast of water at the end of your shower to increase your circulation and feel more awake.\\n3. v4-460px-Start-a-Day-in-a-Healthy-Way-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n4. You might instinctively stretch in the morning, but if not it’s a good habit to incorporate. You don’t have to spend much time stretching to reap the energizing benefits. Even 30 seconds of stretching can help get your day off to a healthy start. If you have more time in the morning, try doing some morning yoga.

As with apples, you'll find a tough core with seeds in the middle of Asian pears. Pick up each pear quarter and use a paring knife to carve out and discard the core section. You should be able to see where the harder, drier core ends and the juicier, more delicate fruit begins. You can also feel the difference with your finger in order to help determine your cut.\\n3. Some people prefer Asian pears chilled, while others think they taste better at room temperature. But there's no wrong choice here—they taste great either way! Asian pears keep much longer in the fridge than on the table—3 months versus 1 week—so it's best to keep them refrigerated. If you like to eat them at room temperature, just let the pear sit on the counter for about an hour before eating it. Rinse the pear and pat it dry with a clean towel before cutting or eating it.\\n4. v4-459px-Eat-Asian-Pears-Step-2.jpg\\n5. Use your paring knife to cut each quarter into 4 or more thin slices. Asian pears are so crisp that they can be cut into very thin slices with a sharp knife. Asian pear slices usually don't brown as quickly as apples, but they will start to turn soon after you cut them.

If you want to be a good team player, you've got to work first on being a good all-around athlete, spending time building the fundamental skills necessary to your sport. If you want to be a great basketball player, that means spending time dribbling, developing your defensive skills, and learning to make crisp passes. If you want to be a great soccer player, you've got to learn to control the ball, shoot accurately, and move to space. It's fun to just get out there and play the sport you play, but doing drills is an essential part of practicing. Instead of just shooting hoops, practice some of the dribbling drills you do in practice, or working on other defensive training drills that you learned from the coaches. Working on building the less-fun skills will help you to stand out and become a stronger player.\\n1. v4-460px-Be-a-Good-Player-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n2. Teams need to be organized and coordinated to win. Silent teams lose and talkative teams improve their chances of winning.

Unless it's absolutely necessary to talk some smack as a way of motivating your teammates. Then, go for it, but be gentle.\\n3. A study of NFL players found that almost 98% were dehydrated before workouts, which can lower performance levels by as much as 25%. Sports drinks and plain water are an important part of maintaining electrolytes and hydration, giving you the energy to perform at your highest level and stay healthy. Before working out, drink 15 or 20 ounces of water, and try to drink about 8 ounce of water every 15 minutes during practice. Drink slowly to avoid upsetting your stomach during intense workouts.\\n4. v4-460px-Be-a-Good-Player-Step-8.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Be-a-Good-Player-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n6. Showing up to practice and giving every single workout your best effort is a critical part of being a good team player. Practice hard and you'll improve your skills and your knowledge of the game, setting you and your team up for success. Show up on time to practice and be prepared to work. Have your gear ready and plenty of water. Start stretching out and getting ready to work. Have a good attitude about practice. Some athletes have lots of talent, but look like they'd rather be at home playing video games than building skills with teammates. Be a better player than that. Leave all your grit and effort on the practice field. If you pull up and take it easy when you're supposed to be lifting weights, running laps, or doing drills, you're going to be slower, weaker, and less talented than your opponents.

You may benefit from a credit counseling or debt management program that includes housing counseling. A counselor can help you better understand what debt assistance options are available, help you manage your obligations, and develop a personalized plan to get through rough financial times. Contact your lender and ask if they have a credit counseling program. The U.S. Department of Justice maintains a list of approved credit counselors by state that you can contact for help. Ask your local housing authority, credit union, nonprofit organization, or extension service if they offer debt counseling.\\n2. Lenders can typically start the foreclosure process after three to five months of missed payments. That means you should make your monthly mortgage payment in full before you pay down unsecured debts like credit cards, hospital bills, medical bills, IRS debts, and student loan payments. If you do fall behind on other bills, you may start getting phone calls from debt collectors. Falling behind on these debts can cause you to accumulate fees and can damage your credit, but the consequences are simply not as serious as falling behind on your mortgage.\\n3. v4-460px-Save-Money-After-Moving-into-a-New-Home-Step-6.jpg', 'question_id': 104409, 'answer_choices': [[3, 1, 2, 0], [2, 3, 1, 0], [1, 2, 3, 0], [0, 3, 2, 1]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10441789.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Foods that naturally contain sugar, such as fruits and veggies, are good to eat. However, go easy on items that contain added sugars, such as sweetened breakfast cereals, desserts, and soft drinks. Eat candy and pastries sparingly, read nutritional labels (especially for cereals, sauces, condiments, and juices), and try sweetening coffee and tea with Stevia extract instead of sugar. Read labels, but note that sugar contents listed under nutrition facts may not include all the added sweeteners. Check the ingredients, which are listed by weight. If you see sugar or words like “sucrose,” “glucose,” “dextrose,” or “high-fructose corn syrup” high up on the list, that product contains a lot of sugar. Added sugars make the pancreas do more work, and they don’t provide any nutritional value. Recommended limits for added sugars for adults are 100 to 150 calories, or 24 to 36 grams per day.\\n1. Smaller meals are easier on your pancreas, and lots of calories all at once can make it work too hard. For instance, instead of having an 8 oz (230 g) chicken breast in a single meal, eat a 3 to 4 oz (85 to 113 g) portion over greens for lunch, and save the rest for dinner. If you have pancreatitis, stick to clear liquids for 1 to 2 days during a flare-up to give your pancreas a break. Clear liquids include water, apple juice, and broth. Stay on the safe side and check with your doctor before fasting during a flare-up. During a pancreatic flare-up, you may experience symptoms such as sharp abdominal pain and tenderness (especially after eating), nausea and vomiting, a rapid pulse, and fever or chills.\\n2. Include healthy sources of fat in your diet, such as vegetable oils, nuts, fish, and avocados. Go for low-fat or fat-free dairy products instead of full-fat options. Steer clear of fried foods, red meat, processed meats (such as bacon or deli meat), butter, and margarine. As a rule of thumb, about 25% of your daily calories should come from fat. Fat contains 9 calories per gram; to find your target daily value in grams, calculate 25% of your daily calories, then divide by 9. For example, 25% of 2500 is 625, and 625 ÷ 9 = 69.4, or about 70 g.\\nIf you’re managing a pancreatic condition, you should consume a fat-free diet if possible. Talk to your doctor about the best way to minimize or eliminate fat in your diet while also getting the nutrients you need.\\n3. v4-460px-Keep-Your-Pancreas-Healthy-Step-2.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Keep-Your-Pancreas-Healthy-Step-4.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Keep-Your-Pancreas-Healthy-Step-6.jpg\\n6. Other lean protein sources include eggs, nuts, beans, and lentils. Your exact daily needs depend on your age, sex, and activity level. In general, women need 5 to 5 ⁄2 oz (140 to 160 g) of protein per day, and men need 6 to 6 ⁄2 oz (170 to 180 g) per day. Eggs and nuts should be eaten in moderation. Try to eat no more than 3 eggs a week, and just a small palmful of nuts daily.

If you’re at home or in a public venue such as a restaurant, washing your hands with soap and water at a sink may also be acceptable.\\n1. The way you feed someone else is similar to how you feed yourself. Tear off a strip of injera with your right hand, then wrap it around some meat or curry. Gently place it in the other person’s mouth, trying not to touch their face. The larger the food, the stronger the bond is between 2 people. This tradition is called “gursha.” Friends, family members, and partners all practice the gesture to show their affection. Ethiopians usually perform this ritual twice a meal.

Most Tesla models come with a mobile connector that you can use in your garage or take with you on the go. It's much like a laptop cord, as you can unplug it into both the wall and the car. To use it at home, plug the large end of the mobile connector into the adapter by lining up the spheres and pushing them together. The connector should come with 2 adapters, one for a 120V plugin and one for a 240V plugin. You'll get a faster charge with the 240V plugin. Use a dedicated outlet for plugging in your Tesla. That is, if your outlet has more than 1 socket, don't plug anything else into the other socket. You could overload the outlet.\\n2. Hold the button down on the mobile connector handle, and remove it when the light on the handle turns white. The car must be unlocked for this to work. The door will close automatically when you pull the connector out if you have a motorized door. If not, just push it closed. If you want to take the mobile connector with you, unplug it and place it in your trunk.\\n3. v4-460px-Charge-a-Tesla-at-Home-Step-4.jpg\\n4. The charging port is on the driver's side near the taillights, similar to where the gas tank would be. Press the button on the mobile connector handle to open the port on your car.

Take precautions as you learn the proper form for the exercise. Lifting heavy weights can be a little intimidating or even risky if you do it wrong. A spotter can check your form and give you feedback to help you avoid injuries as you exercise. Another way to practice is to use a bar without weights. Using the bar gives you an opportunity to refine your form without putting stress on your knees and back.\\n1. v4-460px-Do-a-Romanian-Deadlift-Step-6.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Do-a-Romanian-Deadlift-Step-4.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Do-a-Romanian-Deadlift-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n4. Point your feet towards the bar and step forward. If the barbell is on the floor, it will be at about shin height. If you are too far away from the bar, you will end up leaning forward to reach it. This can throw your back out of alignment, so get as close as possible before you lift the weight.\\n5. Position your hands right beside your legs. Grasp the barbell with your palms facing downward.

Similar to crushing a clove of garlic, set your olive on a cutting board and use the flat side of a broad knife to smash the olive until you feel the pit resisting the knife. Then simply use your fingers to pull the pit away from the meat of the olive. Discard the pit and enjoy the olive.

The bracket’s location will vary widely depending on the vehicle, engine, and catch can manufacturer. Some are designed to be mounted on the side of the strut or shock towers while others may secure to the mounting bolts for an accessory like the alternator or power steering pump. Read the instructions provided with the catch can carefully to find exactly where your catch can bracket is supposed to be mounted. You will likely need to use the right sized wrench to remove one or two bolts or nuts from your vehicle. Slide the bracket into place per the instructions that came with it, then re-secure the bolts or nuts you removed to secure the bracket in place as well.\\n1. While there are universal catch cans on the market, installing them requires some custom fabrication that may be beyond the scope of a hobby mechanic. Instead, provide the year, make, model and engine trim of your vehicle to the clerk at your local auto parts store to get a kit designed specifically for your application. Lower quality catch can kits won’t have any filtration within the catch can, and therefore will do little to prevent oil blow-by. Look for catch can kits that say they have a “filter” or “baffling” system to get a high-quality one.\\n2. The catch can kit should come with two new rubber hoses or lines. The first one should be secured to the PCV valve where you disconnected the last pipe. Run that hose from the PCV valve to the inlet on the oil catch can. Most good quality catch cans will specify which port is meant as an “in” and which is meant as an “out.”\\nUse the supplied hose clamps to secure the hose at both the PCV valve and on the catch can itself. Be careful not to over-tighten hose clamps that you can tighten with a socket or screwdriver. Many PCV valves outlets are made of plastic and may crack if you put them under too much pressure.\\n3. v4-460px-Fix-Engine-Oil-Blow%E2%80%90By-Step-02.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Fix-Engine-Oil-Blow%E2%80%90By-Step-06.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Fix-Engine-Oil-Blow%E2%80%90By-Step-08.jpg\\n6. With the hoses run correctly, slide the catch can into its bracket and tighten the hardware it came with onto the can.

Learn to recognize obsessive, black-and-white thoughts and catch yourself when you jumping to conclusions. It’s one thing to think about your partner’s past or experience emotions about it. However, try to identify when your thoughts race or if you take a past event out of context. Emotions such as anger, sadness, and jealousy are normal. For instance, it’s normal to be sad or cry about something bad your partner did in the past. If you're jealous or insecure about your partner's ex, it’s okay to vent to a loved one about it. On the other hand, try not to obsess over your partner’s past relationships, scour their exes’ social media accounts, or dwell on a minor mistake they made years ago.\\n3. Vent your feelings to a loved one, and ask them for a fresh perspective. They can help you figure out whether the issue is a matter of your perception or a legitimate cause for concern. Confide in someone who’s objective, and keep in mind anything you say may influence that person’s opinion of your partner. For example, suppose your parents are already on the fence about your partner. Talking to them about your partner’s flaws could just worsen their opinion. If you work things out and accept with your partner’s past, your parents could still resent your partner, and you’d be caught in the middle.\", 'question_id': 10444297, 'answer_choices': [[2, 3, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0, 3], [2, 0, 1, 3], [2, 1, 3, 0]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10444474.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Eat-a-Tim-Tam-Step-2.jpg\\n1.

Dry the area with a disposable paper towel instead of a cloth. Leaving it wet could promote bacterial growth. A cloth can harbor bacteria and snag on the piercing, so go with a paper towel.\\n1.

Don’t use cotton balls or cotton wool; the fibers could get caught in the piercing.\\n2. Cleaning the piercing more than twice a day can cause irritation. Use a store-bought saline solution or the cleanser your piercer provided. Alternatively, make your own saline solution by mixing 1/8 teaspoon of non-iodized salt with 1 cup (240 mL) of warm water.

Don't use just any scissors—find some shears especially made for cutting hair, as these will be sharp enough to avoid tearing the ends of your hair when you cut it. A wide-toothed comb is also important when working with curly hair. In fact, the wider the better! This will detangle your hair and it won't stretch out the hair as much and will help prevent frizz. Make sure you only ever use your shears for cutting hair. Using them on other objects makes them become dull more quickly. Stay away from using razors if you have curly hair. This can damage your hair and promote frizz.\\n1. Air-dry your hair, or dry it with a microfiber towel, which is gentler on your hair. Air-drying or gentle towel drying will allow your curls resume their ordinary shape and length. Cutting your hair while it's dry allows you to see immediately what the final cut is going to look like. Furthermore, curls spring up and get shorter as they dry, so you're at risk of cutting your layers too short if you chop them while they're wet. It's okay if your hair is a little damp, as long as it is not wet. Cutting dry hair gives you less control over it, so if you're finding it too hard to manage sectioning and cutting completely dry hair, you can lightly dampen it with a spray bottle.\\n2. v4-460px-Cut-Curly-Hair-in-Layers-Step-2.jpg\", 'question_id': 10444849, 'answer_choices': [[2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0], [0, 2, 1], [0, 2, 1]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/104457.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

Black pepper and chili powder stimulate the release of stomach acid. Other hot ingredients, like hot sauces and vinegar, do the same. When the stomach releases acid, it causes irritation, which can worsen bloating.\\n3. Probiotics are a type of \"good bacteria\" that is commonly used to regulate the digestive system. When the digestive tract is regulated, incidents of bloating are greatly reduced. Bacterial imbalance in your intestines can cause bloating, which is why restoring that balance with probiotics may rid you of your symptoms. Yogurt is the most common source of probiotics, but you can also find them in kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, and miso.

Sugar-free foods aren\\'t a good alternative because the sugar alcohol gets going super fast in your stomach and the bacteria in your intestines goes on overdrive, producing more gas. That gas is the bloating culprit (it\\'s rarely water).\\n6. Water is always your best bet. If that\\'s boring, go for the flavored kinds or infuse your own water with fruit (yum). But tea is good, too; not only does it suppress your appetite, but it also can work as an anti-bloating agent. You know that fizz in soda, pop, or whatever it is you call it? That doesn\\'t go away in your stomach! Those bubbles stay in there and keep on bubbling -- which obviously adds to the gas in your intestines. So apart from them being just empty calories (even the diet ones aren\\'t good for you), they cause you to bloat, too. Need more reasons to quit drinking soda? Drinks that are acidic in nature irritate the GI tract. As a result, the tract swells, causing you to feel bloated. Acidic drinks include coffee, tea, juice, and alcohol. You should also avoid drinks made from sugar substitutes. Sorbitol, xylitol, and mannitol are sugar alcohols that actually bring on bloat.\\n7. v4-460px-Saute-Morel-Mushrooms-Step-12.jpg\\n8. v4-460px-Use-Lemon-Balm-Step-7.jpg', 'question_id': 1044723, 'answer_choices': [[5, 4, 1, 0, 6, 7, 2, 8, 3], [7, 0, 5, 4, 6, 2, 1, 3, 8], [5, 4, 6, 7, 8, 3, 2, 1, 0], [7, 8, 2, 6, 3, 1, 4, 5, 0]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10447596.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Dosa will typically come with sambar and chutney. Sambar is a flavorful vegetable soup and chutney is a spicy condiment.

You need to rest your injury by not using that wrist or arm for at least a day or two. You can apply ice every hour or so for 10 to 20 minutes, especially the day you injure it. Make sure a towel goes between your skin and the ice. Otherwise, it can make your skin too cold. The ice helps with pain and swelling. Compression just means using a splint or bandage. You can take the splint or bandage off to apply ice, but when you\\'re moving around it should be on. Elevation just means getting your wrist above your heart. You can prop it up on a pillow. Because gravity works on blood like everything else, putting your wrist above your heart makes it harder for blood to pool there.

If you\\'re feeling overwhelmed, stressed, and unfocused, making a list is the easiest and quickest way to simplify and help you plan an attack. To learn what you need to focus on now and how to put everything else in the background, make a list of the things that are pressing on your mind. Short-term tasks should be things that are urgent. What needs to be done today, or by the end of the week? You decide the time frame, but try to keep it as urgent as possible. Long term goals are also important, but only if you translate them into a list of specific short-term things that you can do.

Again, don\\'t spend a lot of time calculating, or stressing over this detail. You don\\'t even need an actual number, just break each item into a category called \"Quick\" or \"Slow\" so you\\'ll know when to assign each task. If you know you won\\'t be able to complete all your history research in the ten minutes you have to get something started, you can put it in the back of your mind and do something else instead with your time. Start the laundry, or write up a thank-you note to someone you\\'ve been meaning to get in touch with. That\\'s using your time wisely.\\n5. Be confident and secure in knowing that you\\'ve made a to-do list and you can put it away and ignore it for a while.

Depending on the program, candidates will take courses in theology, philosophy, and other courses meant to provide preparation for a life devoted to religious service. A Master of Divinity degree is awarded at the end of the program. Becoming ordained as a minister through school was the most common path before online ordination became possible. Receiving ordination through school can take several years, and it can be quite expensive. In some cases, a church or religious community will sponsor a member who feels called to ministry.\\n1.

Position the mounting arm so it makes contact with the rim's outer edge in the same spot you've already angled the tire to get past. If you can't squeeze the mounting arm in at that spot, re-adjust the tire to give yourself room to get the mounting arm in. The mounting arm serves as a sort of pry bar to force the rest of the tire over the lip of the rim, so it needs to start in a place where the tire has already made it past that lip.\\n2. The tire machine is designed to accept the rim facing up. Set it on the machine and engage the hydraulic press that secures the rim in place from beneath by pressing the pedal associated with it.

If your lubricant came in a jar rather than a spray bottle, apply the lubricant to the same edges using a cloth or wooden dowel. Don't use dish soap or automotive grease instead of lubricant. The dish soap does not offer enough lubrication and grease can be extremely difficult to clean off of the wheel. You can purchase tire lubricant at your local auto parts store.\\n5. v4-460px-Put-Tires-on-Rims-Step-10.jpg\\n6. As the two rotate, the mounting arm will force the bottom bead of the tire over the rim's top edge.

Mice may be small, but the more space you give them in their captivity the better as they are very active little creatures. It is recommended to house mice in a space that allows them at least one cubic foot of space each. Mice are nocturnal creatures who are sensitive to heat and light. Make sure that you have a space for their cage or aquarium that stays out of direct sunlight and away from strong heat sources.

Medical schools will also look at the difficulty of your classes, and you cannot fulfill your pre-med requirements by taking all easy classes, but it can be a way to provide a small boost.

If you want to work somewhere like a university or a dance conservatory, or if you want to work as a coach for professional dancers, you’ll need at least a graduate degree in dance, although for some positions, a doctorate in dance might be required. These degrees can take years to achieve and the programs can be difficult, but you’ll have a prestigious education when you’re finished. These programs will cover dance techniques, choreography, kinesiology, dance history, and more. Your master’s degree can be in performing arts, fine arts, dance education, or a specific genre like ballet. You will likely work as a student teacher during the program, which will provide you with valuable educational experience. Typically, a PhD is centered on dance education.\\n1. If you want to teach in a public school or some of the more competitive dance studios, you’ll need to complete a dance program at a college or university. There are a number of schools that offer degrees in dance, although you can also major in performing arts or even your preferred genre of dance if you can find a school that offers a program. It will likely be easier to find a school offering programs specific to classic styles of dance, like ballet, than more modern styles like hip hop.

Many individually-owned studios have their own requirements for teachers. If there’s a dance studio near you where you’d like to teach, contact the owner and ask them what certification you would need to work there. They may offer a certificate program through the school, or they may have you become certified through an independent organization. Some studios will have more stringent requirements than others. In some cases, the studio may only want you to demonstrate your dance experience, especially if you’re applying for a part-time or assistant position, or if it’s a non-competitive local dance studio. In the UK, you will most likely need a specialized qualification from the Council for Dance Education and Training. In the US, programs vary. Some popular dance teacher certification groups are the Royal Academy of Dance, the American Ballet Theatre, the National Dance Teachers Association of America, and the American Tap Dance Foundation.\\n5. v4-460px-Become-a-Dance-Teacher-Step-7.jpg\\n6. You can't teach what you don't understand, so find a genre you love and work hard to learn it. Take dance classes and private lessons, and consider participating in competitions, performances, and dance intensives to constantly improve your skills. In addition, dancing is physically demanding, so take good care of your body by eating well, practicing proper form with an instructor, and knowing when to rest. It can take years of training before you're ready to teach others. Many professional dancers start dancing as young children, although some don't take their first lesson until much later. Try out a few different dance styles to see what you like. Some of the most popular genres of dance include: ballet, tap, ballroom, jazz, hip-hop, liturgical, and modern dance. Go on auditions if you want to dance with a production, like as a back-up dancer for a musician or a stage show.

From finding the bones, to clearing them of soft tissue, to cleaning them, always wear rubber gloves. You’ll be working with animal matter and tissue and will come into contact with some pretty nasty stuff. Depending on the stage of decomposition of the bones, you may also want to wear a respiratory mask.\\n1. v4-460px-Clean-Bones-Step-4.jpg\\n2. This is a great way to clean bones that you find out in nature that are already mostly clear of soft tissue. Buy biological washing powder from your grocery store (you can usually find it in the laundry aisle). Put your bones in a plastic container, cover them with warm water, and then add in a small scoop of the biological powder. Leave the bones alone for 3-4 days, and then rinse them off thoroughly. Biological washing powder has little enzymes in it that break down soft tissues, like fat, skin, and ligaments. You can use this method to clean off any residual tissue no matter what condition the corpse was in when you first found it.\\n3. v4-460px-Clean-Bones-Step-2.jpg\\n4. This process helps the decomposition process move along a little more quickly than just letting the corpse sit above ground. Put the corpse into a plastic container or garbage bag and cover it with cold water. Set it somewhere out of the way and check it monthly to see how the decomposition is getting along. Soaking bones that have already mostly decomposed is also a great way to soften connective tissue and tendons to make them easier to cut through. Remember to always wear gloves when touching or checking the corpse! This process is going to smell really, really bad for several months. If you live in a city or an apartment building, this may not be the best option.\\n5. v4-460px-Clean-Bones-Step-6.jpg', 'question_id': 10455729, 'answer_choices': [[2, 4, 1, 0, 5, 3], [0, 4, 3, 5, 2, 1], [0, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5], [2, 4, 0, 5, 1, 3]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10455807.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Do-a-Background-Check-Step-15-Version-2.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Use-a-Blog-for-Business-Step-10.jpg\\n2. Google Adwords lets you bid on keywords that customers might type into a search bar when looking for a product or service. Search results are then posted in order from highest to lowest bid. You only pay for Adwords if a customer clicks on your page. It\\'s a great way to drive traffic to your site without paying a lot of money. For example, a cat sitter might bid on the keywords \"cat kennel.\" If someone Googles these key words, the cat sitter\\'s business will come up. If your business has a lot of competition, the best keywords can become expensive. If this happens, you can choose related keywords. For example, a landscaper might find that \"lawncare\" is very expensive. Instead, they might bid on \"lawn mowing\" or \"grass cutting.\"\\n3. A web presence is essential for your business. Your website can attract customers and show them what your business has to offer. Depending on your business, you might sell your inventory through your website or make it easier for customers to request your services. You can set up a free website through several hosting platforms, such as Wordpress or Wix. Keep in mind that your website name will include .wordpress.com or .wix.com, which can be a turn-off. For example, www.maryscraftstore.wordpress.com. For a monthly or annual fee, you can reserve your own website domain through sites like Squarespace, Wordpress, and Wix. These sites have templates that help you design a professional site. Buying your domain also lets you drop the hosting platform\\'s tag, streamlining your website to www.maryscraftstore.com.\\n4. You can send out a regular newsletter or simply remind customers about sales, new inventory, or special events at your business. Ask customers to provide their email at checkout, get them to sign up for your newsletter, or do a giveaway in exchange for email addresses. Create a mailing list with every email you’ve collected. If you know someone’s email, include it even if they haven’t patronized your business before. As an example, you might give a small discount to people who sign up for your newsletter to build your email list. If you want to do a giveaway, ask customers to provide their name and email address in order to enter the contest. On the contest deadline, draw out a winning entry. Notify the winner by email.\\n5. v4-460px-Save-Money-Fast-Step-3-Version-3.jpg\\n6. Your Yelp page can let potential customers know who you are, what services or products you offer, and how they can find you. You can post photos of your goods or services, as well as your storefront if you have one. Customers can review your business on your page, and you can write a response. Upgrading your account for a small fee removes ads from your page, lets you customize your photos, and gives you access to customer service support. Yelp offers two ways to advertise. First, you can create a Yelp Deal or Check-In offer to encourage customers to patronize your business. This option is available with your free Yelp page.

If you look at a ready-to-use cable tie, notice that one end tapers to a point, while the other is capped with a tiny cube. When used, the pointy end is fed through a slot in the cube to form a loop and then pulled tight. The cube is the locking mechanism that keeps the tie from worming back out through the slot, so look for that.\\n3. Look underneath the loose end where it comes out of the cube.

If the high heeled look is what you’re after, start out with lower or thicker heels. Look for heels that are an inch-high or smaller, with a thick heel or even a platform sole. These platforms are known as wedges, which refers to the solid block, or “wedge,” that runs from heel to toe and supports the foot while adding height. A low-heeled boot can also be a great way to ease into wearing higher heels, for your own physical comfort as well as subtlety. If this is your first time wearing heels, choose lower heels or wedges for your first pair. The next set of heels can be the height you want, such as sky-high stilettos.\\n1. If you want to look taller without the obvious addition of heels, elevator shoes are the choice for you. They look like regular dress shoes, but contain an extra insert inside, either attached to the shoe or removable, that can add anywhere from 1-6 in (2.5-15.2 cm) of height.

This cheese contains a lot of water, which evaporates quickly. Your burrata will be less creamy the longer you wait to eat it. Try to find cheese that was made within the past day, if possible. Burrata can be found in specialty grocery stores or cheese shops. If your local store has a dairy counter, ask them when the burrata was made so you know it’s fresh.\\n1. A half hour to an hour before you want to enjoy the burrata, set it out at room temperature so it can warm up a little. This will ensure that the creamy center of the burrata is not too solid. You can also put your cheese in a bowl of warm water for 10 minutes to warm it up. Most burrata comes in a small bag, so you can place that directly in the water.

To toast bread, slice a baguette into ⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) slices and bake for 5 minutes at 400 °F (204 °C). Flip over each slice, bake another 5 minutes, and brush with olive oil once it’s done.

If you’re traveling down the road at a consistent speed and the vehicle abruptly slows down or the RPMs drop significantly on your tachometer (when equipped), it may be a sign that the fuel pump is struggling to deliver enough fuel to the engine. RPMs are the number of revolutions your engine makes per minute, so a drop in RPMs represents a drop in how quickly your engine is spinning and the power it can produce. Look for warning lights on your dashboard that may indicate other potential issues to explain the power loss. A battery light, for instance, might suggest an electrical issue, or a flashing check engine light indicates that the engine is misfiring. In the absence of those indicators, sudden (temporary) power loss is a good sign that there’s a problem with your fuel pump.\\n2. The most common symptom of a clogged fuel pump is an intermittent power loss caused by the pump failing to push enough fuel to the injectors to keep the engine running properly. If your engine sputters or even stalls when you take your foot off of the gas, there may be an issue with your fuel pump or filter. If the engine stalls, but then will run again after a few minutes, it’s likely because of sediment building up in the fuel filter or pump. As the sediment settles, the blockage clears and that fuel will begin to flow until it builds up again. You should also consider replacing your fuel filter.\\n3. v4-460px-Clean-a-Fuel-Pump-Step-4.jpg', 'question_id': 10458905, 'answer_choices': [[2, 1, 3, 0], [2, 1, 3, 0], [2, 3, 0, 1], [2, 0, 1, 3]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10459033.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Find-the-Routing-Number-Without-a-Check-Step-2.jpg\\n1.

If your dog wants to turn tail and hide in its safe space, perhaps its crate, cover it with a light blanket, to help muffle the frightening sound. Again, the method you choose to employ to calm your dog all depends on what it is afraid of. You can create a safe space for your dog, by opening a door to a room away from the loud sounds or your can crate train it.

Some like soft gentle strokes, while others like hardy pats and squeezes. One of the most common petting strategies is the gentle sweep of the back. Place the palm of your hand on the top of your dog's head and slowly follow your dog's spine to its hips. Do this repeatedly in order to calm your dog. However, be aware that petting your dog can be misread by the dog as being rewarded for feeling fearful. Counterintuitive as it sounds, petting the dog can inadvertently train him to be fearful in future. Judge the situation, but sometimes it is much better to ignore his fearful behavior which sends the message that there's nothing to worry about.\\n3. v4-460px-Calm-a-Dog-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n4.

Dog body language is complex and can often be misread.There is no universal sign of anxiety or fear to look for because every dog reacts differently. It is not unusual for one fearful dog to act aggressive and another to run away and hide. Both dogs want to be safe, but they process the situation differently. Signs of Anxiety in a Dog- Hunched body posture- Averted gaze/dilated pupils- Ears held down or slightly backwards- Furrowed brow- Whining- Shaking/shivering- Sweaty paws- Loss of bladder or bowel control\", 'question_id': 1046194, 'answer_choices': [[0, 5, 1, 2, 6, 4, 3], [1, 3, 6, 5, 4, 2, 0], [6, 0, 1, 3, 2, 5, 4], [2, 0, 5, 4, 1, 6, 3]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10462903.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

Whether or not your hair is naturally red or dyed red, you still need to know what shade it is before you can make an informed decision about what color of brown you'll need to buy.

Some of the common “reds” are:\\nStrawberry blonde\\nBright copper\\nGinger\\nClassic red\\nDeep red\\nAuburn\\nRed velvet\\nRuby red\\n1. Because red tones are so hard to cover, even those with naturally red hair will want to consider bleaching their hair before applying colored dye. Look for a bleach kit that includes bleach, developer, gloves, bowl, and applicator brush. You can always try dyeing your hair without bleaching it first, but you probably won't have as good results. Keep in mind that color doesn't lift color. If you've already dyed your hair, you won't be able to lighten it with a different color dye. However, you can dye your hair a darker color. A dark brown dye may take without you having to bleach yourself first.\\n2. If you have pale skin, opt for a rich brown with warm undertones for a look that complements your skin. If you have tan or more olive-toned skin, opt for an ashy or more muted brown. If you have deep undertones, look for a more intensely dark brown. Avoid picking a shade of brown that is similar to your skin tone.

Jealousy only works if the guy has feelings for you. If he's totally not interested, you'll have a very hard time making him jealous. The good news is, any guy you're dating or that you have dated is almost certainly interested in you, and the same can be said with guys that have been flirting with you. If you're not sure if a guy is into you, you can just try to make him jealous anyway. Though it's impossible to know if he has feelings for you with 100% certainty without asking, there are many tell-tale signs that he has a crush on you. If he pays extra attention to you in groups, makes a point of ignoring you in groups, or is always caught staring at you, then chances are, he has a crush on you. Of course, if you play your cards right, you can make a guy notice you more by trying to make him jealous, but this will be harder to do if there isn't some interest in the beginning.\\n1.

Your dog will understand body language just as much as a command. Stand tall and issue the command in an authoritative voice, but don’t try to scare your dog. You want her to want to understand and obey the command instead of simply frightening her.\\n3. v4-460px-Tell-Your-Dog-No-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n4. The goal of teaching your dog any command is to help her associate the command with the desired behavior while strengthening the connection with positive reinforcement. To teach her “no” or “leave it,” begin by showing her the behavior you want. For example, show her a treat in your hand, and then say “no” before closing your fist around the treat. Let her sniff and lick at your hand, but don’t give her the treat. Once she stops trying and turns away, offer her plenty of praise and provide a treat from your other hand—not the enclosed one. Use a stern voice to issue the command, but don’t yell or otherwise make your dog think you’re punishing her. Use a neutral, stern voice as opposed to the happy voice you usually use with your dog, so she doesn’t mistake the command for positive reinforcement.\\n5. As your dog begins obeying the command regularly, decrease the instances where you provide a treat while still providing all of the praise for obeying the order. She will continue to obey even if you only provide a treat once every four or five times she responds to the command as long as you remain consistent with the other aspects of positive reinforcement.\\n6. “No” is easier when your dog can’t reach the treat anyway (when it’s in your fist). The next step is to place the treat on the floor with your hand guarding the treat rather than completely enclosing it. You may have to start with your hand completely around the treat, but over several repetitions, begin lifting your hand until she stops when you say “no” even with the treat in the open. To help make this successful, use a treat she likes but doesn’t love on the floor. Reserve her favorite type of treat for when you provide the praise and treat when she leave the one of the floor alone. Be very consistent with the positive reinforcement. Remember that you should wait to provide the treat until your dog looks at you when you say “no.”\\nThe process will require patience and lots of repetitions.', 'question_id': 104685, 'answer_choices': [[4, 3, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5], [5, 0, 1, 6, 4, 2, 3], [3, 4, 0, 2, 6, 5, 1], [6, 5, 4, 2, 1, 3, 0]], 'answer_id': 0}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10468661.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

If you have used an attorney\\'s services in the past, live next to an attorney, or work with one, do not hesitate to ask them for a referral. The legal community is relatively small and most lawyers have a network of other lawyers that work in every field. If you talk to an attorney, ask if they can get you in contact with someone specializing in sex crime defense or sexual assault civil cases. Referrals are often the easiest and best way to find a highly qualified attorney. In general, if other lawyers are recommending someone, chances are they are good at what they do.\\n2. If you have been accused, suspected, or charged with a sex crime, you need to contact an attorney as soon as possible. Sex crimes are incredibly serious offenses that may lead to imprisonment and a life on the sex offender registry. Do not talk to police or investigators until you have hired an attorney or have had one appointed to you. Do not wait to hire an attorney until you are formally charged. It is important to hire a qualified attorney at the earliest possible stages.\\n3. v4-460px-Get-a-Job-in-Another-State-Step-10.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Earn-Your-Parents%27-Trust-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n5. In addition to checking your state bar\\'s website, check other online services for client reviews. These services, including Avvo, FindLaw, Lawyers.com, and others will provide valuable information about the lawyer, which may include feedback from past clients. Read each lawyer\\'s reviews but be aware that there are many reasons for both positive and negative reviews. For example, a positive review may come from a friend who is simply trying to boost their buddy\\'s business. On the other side, a negative review may come from a client who lost their case for reasons out of the attorney\\'s control. Take each review seriously but be aware of possible flaws.\\n6. Many states offer specialization programs that allow attorneys to be recognized as experts in a certain legal field. For example, in California, lawyers can become State Bar certified in criminal law when they pass a written test and demonstrate a high level of experience. Even if your state does not offer specialization programs, some attorneys may hold themselves out as focusing on certain areas of the law. With this in mind, ask any attorney you talk with if they have handled sex crime cases or if they know someone who does. It is especially important to find a focused attorney when your issue is related to a sex crime. The prosecution and defense of sex crimes is unique in many ways and requires someone with specialized knowledge. Due to the public\\'s perception of the accused, the requirement of having to cross-examine children, and the troubles of finding an impartial jury, you need to find someone who has dealt with these issues before.\\n7. v4-460px-Say-Goodbye-to-Coworkers-Step-12.jpg\\n8. While many attorneys choose not to advertise their services, a growing number have turned to the internet. Do a quick internet search for \"sex crime defense attorneys\" in your location and see what comes up. Visit some of the websites you find and analyze what you see. An attorney\\'s website should be clean and straightforward. In addition, it should contain the lawyer\\'s name, background, and specialties.

You can purchase a diamond tester online. Check the device to see if it has a full battery by making sure that the green light is on. Then, press the tip of the tester against the suspected diamond. If it makes a noise and lights up, the mineral is a diamond. If it doesn’t, then it is a different kind of gemstone. Diamond testers use thermal and electric conductivity to determine whether your gemstone is a diamond. Cheaper diamond testing devices may not be as accurate as more expensive models. #*Read customer reviews before you make your purchase.\\n1. v4-460px-Identify-Raw-Diamonds-Step-2.jpg\\n2. Diamonds are cubic, while other similar stones like quartz are hexagonal. Look down at the point of the crystal and count the number of sides. If there are 4 sides, there’s a possibility the crystal is a diamond. If there are 6 sides, it means that it’s likely a quartz crystal. The visual test is a quick way to rule out other gemstones but is not a definitive test. If you see 4 sides in the crystal, use additional methods to verify that it is, in fact, a diamond.

There are several prescription options available for treating pubic lice, but they should be used as a last resort.

If you want to try to flex your pecs right now, drop and give yourself twenty push-ups. Anytime you want your pecs to appear larger and more muscular, it's good to drop to the floor work them out for a minute. This forces blood into the muscle, making it swell and making it much more easy to flex it in a visible way. If you've just finished a workout, it's the perfect time to flex in the mirror for a while and check out whether or not your pecs are bounceable yet. It'll take a while, but you'll always have better results after a workout instead of before.\\n3. In the mirror, with your pecs well-exercised, stand with your arms straight down at your sides and attempt to contract your pectoral muscles. It should be a lot easier if you've just worked them out. If they're burning, you'll be able to feel very quickly whether or not you're doing it right. Turn your upper arm (humerus) in toward your chest and you should feel your pec flexing. That's one of the functions of the pectoralis major muscle: rotating your upper arm. Don't worry about flexing them each separately yet, just worry about flexing them both on command. At first, it's hard enough to do just that. If you're like most people, your pecs probably aren't something you're used to flexing on purpose. But, once you get a feel for where they are and how to do it, it can be as easy as flexing your bicep.\\n4. Once you've got it figured out, it's important to commit to keeping your chest strong and your pecs bulging.

Raising baby chickens is a  rewarding experience, but it is not something you should jump into too quickly. Before you raise baby chickens, think long and hard about why you want to keep chickens and whether you have the time, money and space to provide for them. In terms of expense, keeping chickens is relatively cheap compared to other animals. However, chicken feed is a necessary and ongoing expense, and vets' bills can add up if one or more of your chickens falls ill. You may also need to invest in a brooder and/or a coop if you are raising chickens for the first time. Chickens are not terribly time-consuming, but you will need to feed and water them daily, keep their coop clean (which involves shoveling manure) and collect their eggs once or twice daily. If you are planning on going away for more than a couple of days, you will need to seek out a chicken-sitter, which can be tricky. If you let eggs accumulate in the nest boxes, the hens may become broody, which is where they will peck or cluck at you if you attempt to collect the eggs. To discourage this, look into a broody box.\\n1. You can find day-old baby chickens at your local farm store in springtime, or order them from a mail-order catalog. Be aware that mail orders usually have a minimum order policy, requiring a shipment of at least 25 chicks. This is because larger numbers of chicks are easier to keep warm in transit, resulting in fewer losses. However, open the box in front of the mail carrier to account for any losses. Place your order in spring. You don't want to be ordering in the middle of autumn or winter. Colder weather can hold you back and be much harder to care for your chickens. If you order at the start of spring it'll be easier for you and the chicks. Besides, most chicks are only available to order in spring. If you only want three or four chicks to start off, consider combining your order with the orders of other local chicken breeders or farmers to overcome the minimum shipment requirement. Alternatively, you can ask a farm-supply store if they will include your order in their own. If possible, specify that you want all females when you place your order. Roosters can be loud and aggressive and are not recommended for first-timers. The hens will also lay better without roosters around.\\n2. v4-460px-Raise-Baby-Chickens-Step-6.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Raise-Baby-Chickens-Step-2.jpg\\n4. Chickens are very sociable creatures, so you should plan on keeping at least three to six birds for company. Having an extra one or two is also not a bad idea should any of your chickens fall victim to predators or disease. In addition, hens typically lay 5-6 eggs a week, so four birds will provide you with almost two dozen eggs per week.

Breadboards are often used in temporary circuits, prototypes and small circuit projects, such as this one. Breadboards are very useful and easy to understand. Breadboards have holes called pins which could be used to insert wires or components. Inside the breadboard, the pins are soldered together, meaning they are connected to each other. These pins, however, are soldered in vertical or horizontal patterns. So you can only connect them in straight lines. The pins next to the red and blue lines going down the long side of the board are usually called power rails, these pins are connected vertically to each other inside the board. The terminals near the middle of the board are connected horizontally.\\n3. 460px-Arduio-LED.png\\n4. The LED needs some resistance so that less current flows through it. Without a resistor, you might end up damaging LED. We're going to use a 220-ohm resistor.

Make sure not to connect both ends of the resistor to the same side of the breadboard. This would create a short making the current jump past the resistor making it useless. Add one end to the left and one end to the right side of the center.\\n5. An ultrasonic sensor uses sound to determine distance.

Your labrador retriever has a huge appetite. It loves to eat, so it may carry its food bowl around with them, beg for food, or eat unconventional things. This is normal. The exact quantity of food you give your lab depends on which food you're offering and how many calories it contains. Follow the feeding guidelines on the food packaging, and increase or decrease the amount depending on whether the dog loses or gains weight on this ration. If your dog is more active than most dogs, then you should increase its food intake accordingly. For instance, if every morning you and your furry friend go for a 5 mile jog together, you should consider giving it more food than usual. Obviously, you don’t want your labrador to become obese. If you cannot easily feel its rib bones anymore, then you are probably overfeeding it.

Every dog needs certain core vaccinations on a regular basis. It is a good idea to take your dog to the vet at least twice a year for routine exams to monitor its health and to establish a good relationship with your veterinary staff. If your pet should get hurt or is not acting normally, it is always a good idea to visit the veterinarian for an exam and medical care if needed. Your vet will also prescribe necessary medicines (topical and supplemental) to help ward off parasites like fleas and ticks. As your dog ages, you may see such health issues as hip dysplasia, epilepsy, or seizures. Your labrador retriever may also experience eye problems. If any of these are happening to your dog, immediately contact your vet and talk about possible treatment solutions or medications. An elderly dog with any such conditions should see a vet every two months or as advised by your vet.\\n3. v4-460px-Care-for-a-Labrador-Retriever-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Care-for-a-Labrador-Retriever-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\\n5. You lab needs a lot of exercise in order to stay healthy. Walk your lab up to three times a day and if you can, take it on long walks of a couple miles or more. If you have a backyard, make sure that it is big enough for your dog to run around. Small backyards are not suitable for big dogs like labs.\\n6. Your Labrador's ears can become breeding grounds for bacteria if not cleaned regularly and properly. Check the dog's ears regularly for any excessive or smelly discharge, and seek veterinary advice if you notice anything amiss.

Labradors are a short-haired breed that come in brown, black, and gold. For most of the year, your lab will remain fairly low maintenance. During the summer, you’ll want to brush it regularly — weekly is best — to remove loose hair from its coat. Brushing your lab will also help remove dirt and spread natural oils throughout. Don’t bathe your lab too often. The natural oils in your lab's fur can even help fend off fleas and ticks. Bathe your lab 3 or 4 times a year or whenever its stench gets too strong.\\n8. v4-460px-Care-for-a-Labrador-Retriever-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\", 'question_id': 1047973, 'answer_choices': [[0, 6, 4, 1, 5, 8, 7, 3, 2], [4, 8, 1, 5, 3, 2, 7, 6, 0], [0, 4, 5, 8, 7, 1, 6, 3, 2], [0, 8, 1, 5, 3, 2, 6, 4, 7]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1047982.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Say-Hello-in-Switzerland-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n1.

You may even be able to pin down the pronunciation of certain words by listening to how the people around you say them. Look at signs, notices, and advertisements.

Some writers may prefer to plan out the plot before deciding on a setting. However, in comedic writing, humor is often based on situations. Before you start writing out the storyline for your work, it may be helpful to consider where your story might take place and how you can derive humor from that setting. Try to be original in choosing your setting. Readers may be turned off if it\\'s a setting they\\'re too familiar with, as it may feel like the story has been recycled. Also, keep in mind that a vivid description of your setting will help reader to feel like they are there and this may help to make the story even funnier. For short stories, it\\'s best to stick with as few setting changes as possible. Aim to work within just one setting, but don\\'t exceed two.\\n2. Every story needs interesting, realistic characters. A funny story needs interesting, realistic characters who either have funny qualities or who find themselves in funny situations. How you depict the characters may depend on their personalities and circumstances within the story. For example, you might depict a bumbling \"idiot\" character who stumbles into funny situations, or a sarcastic character who thinks he knows it all and realizes that he doesn\\'t know anything about his own circumstances. Make sure your characters are realistic and believable. A good character should have feelings/opinions and should be capable of reacting to his or her situation in realistic ways on the page. Think about what kinds of characters could make your setting funny, or vice versa.

Work in an upwards motion along your top lashes, and a downwards motion on your bottom lashes. Use a similar motion as you would when applying mascara. This will set your lashes in the proper shape and minimize their tangling while you sleep. To avoid poking your eyes with the brush, close one eye and brush upwards on those lashes. Then repeat the process for the other eye. Purchase a spoolie brush in the beauty or cosmetic section at a local department store, or online with major retailers. A spoolie brush looks like a mascara applicator and can be used to comb your eyelashes and eyebrows.\\n2. Use a towel to gently dry your face, and be extra careful when drying the skin around your eyes. Avoid rubbing or dragging the towel across your face to dry it, as this might cause some of the lashes to fall out. Eyelash extensions can take quite a while to dry, which can leave them feeling unnaturally heavy. Use a hairdryer on the lowest setting to gently speed up the air-drying process.\\n3. Put some of the cleanser on a cotton swab, and gently pat the skin around your eyes to remove makeup or dirt. Continue this process until all of the makeup has been removed. You will have more control using a cotton swab over a cotton pad to remove the makeup, and won't bump your eyelashes as much. Use oil-free makeup removers like micellar cleansers to remove the makeup from around your eyes. If you opt to use a cotton pad with the cleanser, dab your eyelids instead of rubbing them to remove the makeup, as excess rubbing will damage the lashes and cause shedding. Apply mascara to your eyelash extensions sparingly to avoid weakening the follicles.

It is important to make sure the jacket is safe to machine-wash so that you don’t end up ruining the fabric. Keep in mind that not all types of jackets will be easy to shrink in the washing machine.

There are many different species of fugu, all of which are poisonous. While they are all potentially dangerous, the torafugu or tiger puffer has the least poisonous blood, which makes it the safest to eat.\\n1.

Doctors can use activated charcoal to absorb the poison and can also help you breathe so you don\\'t asphyxiate from the toxin\\'s effects.

This is meant to ensure that only the most skilled and well-trained chefs are allowed prepare this potentially deadly fish. If you plan on trying it, make sure to ask for evidence that the chef is properly licensed. To get licensed, a chef must undergo a three-year apprenticeship program and take a rigorous exam, which the majority of applicants fail. Chefs in the United States may not have this license, as they do not slice the sashimi themselves. (This is still done by a licensed individual in Japan.)\\n3. The fugu fish produces a deadly toxin called tetrodotoxin, which causes the body\\'s central nervous system to gradually shut down. People who are poisoned by tetrodotoxin are fully conscious as they experience symptoms like dizziness, muscle paralysis, incoherent speech, asphyxia, and cardiac arrest. Fugu is safe to eat when it is prepared correctly by an experienced chef, but if it is prepared incorrectly, a single bite can kill a person.

Most schools have guidance counselors whose job it is to handle situations like this. If you are being bullied by a teacher, make an appointment with your guidance counselor to talk about it. They’ll talk to you about what the teacher is doing, how it makes you feel, and what can be done to resolve the situation.

It’s normal to feel upset and defensive if you feel like someone is threatening your livelihood. However, it’s important that you have a calm, professional reaction. When something upsets you, take a few minutes to calm yourself down. Take deep breaths and picture yourself responding calmly.

Don’t get upset and tell your boss about all of your coworker’s flaws. Instead, take a deep breath and count to 10.

Carry a small notebook with you and jot down your thoughts when you start to feel anxious. Notice how you feel around others. You may find certain people tend to increase your anxiety. It may be a good idea to lessen contact with those people.\\n4. There are some physical preparations that you can make to help prevent nervousness as well. Some things that you can do to physically prepare yourself include:\\nGetting plenty of rest. Aim for 8 hours of sleep every night so that you are well rested. This may help to prevent nervousness. Exercising. Try to get 30 minutes of cardiovascular activity every day to help prevent nervousness. For example, you can take a walk, go for a swim, or ride a stationary bike. Eating a healthy meal or snack. Hunger may produce symptoms that look like nervousness, so make sure you have eaten something. Try having a sandwich or an apple if you have not eaten in a while.\\n5. v4-460px-Prevent-Nervousness-Step-6.jpg', 'question_id': 1048630, 'answer_choices': [[4, 5, 1, 2, 0, 3], [3, 1, 2, 0, 4, 5], [0, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5], [5, 3, 0, 2, 1, 4]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1048800.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

If you’re hoping to keep a wild caught toad as a pet, see the corresponding wikiHow article for more specific steps. The first step, of course, is providing your toad a habitat. Use a ten gallon fish tank, or comparable container, with a tight fitting lid. If you continue to practice your toad hunting skills, each new acquisition requires about 5 gallons worth of space. If you catch baby toads, smaller plastic ‘critter keepers’ from the pet store will be more than sufficient for housing before the toad nears full size – which can be over four inches long! Clean the interior of the toad’s enclosure once a month with heavily diluted bleach – shoot for about 5% bleach and 95% water. If you only intend to keep your toad for a few days, a box with a reliably closing lid and no holes larger than a dime will also work.\\n1. v4-460px-Catch-a-Toad-Step-6.jpg\\n2. You can find toads almost anywhere there is consistent moisture. Toads will be especially easy to find near the concrete foundation of buildings and porches after it rains. Check under logs, near stumps, and under rocks near water as well. During the spring, male toads will relax in pools of water and call to female toads, hoping to attract company, not to mention the chance to procreate. Once you find a toad, don’t make any sudden movements. Approach it slowly. Be careful not to squish the toad when moving any rocks or other heavy materials.\\n3. You also need to ensure the toad’s home is appropriately decorated and kept at the right temperature. Similarly, the proper amount of light is vital, as is adequate humidity. Most importantly, provide a wide, shallow pool of water for your toad to soak in. Carefully add a piece of wood. Your toad will likely burrow right beneath it. A hollowed out log is even more exciting, as a lazy toad can simply post up inside of it. As long as there is adequate substrate and you keep it clean and moist, the toad will be able to regulate it’s temperature. Room temperature is okay, even with natural cooling of 10-15 degrees F in the evening. Toads do not need artificial lighting for warmth. Replace the water in their toad tubs daily.\\n4. v4-460px-Catch-a-Toad-Step-4.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Catch-a-Toad-Step-2-Version-3.jpg', 'question_id': 104883, 'answer_choices': [[0, 1, 4, 2, 3, 5], [3, 4, 2, 0, 1, 5], [3, 2, 4, 0, 1, 5], [2, 5, 0, 4, 3, 1]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1048856.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Divide-Binary-Numbers-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Divide-Binary-Numbers-Step-2-Version-3.jpg\\n2. This works just like a decimal long division problem, but it\\'s actually quite a bit easier in binary. Either you can\\'t divide the number by the divisor (0) or the divisor can go in one time (1):\\n11 > 1, so 11 can\\'t \"go into\" 1. Write a 0 as the first digit of the quotient (above the first digit of the dividend).\\n3. If it\\'s been a while since you did long division with ordinary decimal (base ten) numbers, review the basics using the problem 172 ÷ 4. Otherwise, skip ahead to the next step to learn the same process in binary. The dividend is divided by the divisor, and the answer is the quotient. Compare the divisor to the first digit in the dividend. If the divisor is the larger number, keep adding digits to the dividend until the divisor is the smaller number. (For example, if calculating 172 ÷ 4, we would compare 4 and 1, note that 4 > 1, and compare 4 to 17 instead.) Write the first digit of the quotient above the last dividend digit you were using in the comparison. Comparing 4 and 17, we see that 4 goes into 17 four times, so we write 4 as the first digit of our quotient, above the 7. Multiply and subtract to find the remainder. Multiply the quotient digit with the divisor, in this case 4 x 4 = 16. Write the 16 underneath the 17, then subtract 17 - 16 to find the remainder, 1. Repeat. Once again, we compare the divisor 4 with the next digit, 1, note that 4 > 1, and \"bring down\" the next digit of the dividend, to compare 4 with 12 instead. 4 goes into 12 three times with no remainder, so we write 3 as the next digit of the quotient. The answer is 43.\\n4. As in decimal long division, we multiply the digit we just found (1) with the divisor (11), and write the result underneath our dividend aligned with the digit we just calculated. In binary, we can shortcut this, since 1 x the divisor always equals the divisor:\\nWrite the divisor underneath the dividend. Here, we write 11 aligned underneath the first three digits (101) of the dividend. Calculate 101 - 11 to get the remainder, 10. See how to subtract binary numbers if you need a review.\\n5. Sometimes, the result is not an integer. If you still have a remainder after using the final digit, add a \".0\" to the dividend and a \".\" to your quotient, so you can bring down another digit and continue. Repeat until you reach the desired specificity, then round the answer. On paper you can round down by chopping off the last 0, or if the last digit is a 1, drop it and add 1 to the new last digit. In programming, follow one of the standard algorithms for rounding to avoid errors when converting between binary and decimal numbers. Binary division problems often end up with repeating fractional portions, more often than they occur in decimal notation. This is referred to with the more general term \"radix point,\" which applies in any base, since the \"decimal point\" is only used in the decimal system.\\n6. v4-460px-Divide-Binary-Numbers-Step-6-Version-2.jpg', 'question_id': 1048856, 'answer_choices': [[5, 2, 4, 1, 0, 6, 3], [3, 1, 2, 0, 4, 6, 5], [6, 5, 1, 0, 4, 2, 3], [4, 2, 6, 1, 5, 3, 0]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10489196.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

Your feelings have a great deal to tell you about where you should set your limits. Anything that makes you feel resentment or discomfort should raise a red flag for you. Sometimes anger, too, can be the result of going beyond your personal limits. If a situation or personal interaction makes you feel resentful or a level of discomfort that is not reasonable, then ask yourself what is causing that feeling. Do you feel taken advantage of or not appreciated? Are you responding that way because of someone else’s expectations about you?

These exercises can help you see what having \"strong but flexible\" boundaries – what experts say are the best kind – feels like. Psychologists have developed exercises you can use to help visualize your boundaries are so that you will know the right times to say no. Choose a type of boundary you are interested in exploring – mental, physical, or emotional. Focus on this type of boundary while you do this exercise. Close your eyes and imagine you are in the middle of a circle you have drawn around yourself. Make the circle as big or small as you want – give yourself the amount of space that feels best for you. Imagine your circle turning into a wall. Make your imaginary wall out of anything you like – thick glass, grey cement, bricks and mortar – just make sure that your wall is strong. Now imagine yourself having the power to be in control of the wall. You can melt a temporary hole to let something in or out, you can open a tiny window, or you can pull a brick out of the wall to make an opening. Think about being in control of your wall, and about being safe and powerful inside the circle you have built. Stay inside the wall for one minute. Repeat the exercise once a day.\\n5. A boundary is the line between what is OK and what is not OK. Consider your physical, emotional, and mental boundaries. Physical boundaries involve privacy, space, and your body. This may be dictated both by your personal preferences and philosophies, your culture, and things such as your faith. For example, what kinds of activities you are willing to engage in on a first date. One person may be only comfortable with a kiss, while another is eager for more. (One is not better or worse than another, just different.) Boundaries can change. Time, circumstances, and so on can change what a person\\'s boundaries are one way or another. Emotional boundaries are where you set the line between your responsibility for your own feelings versus others’ feelings. Mental boundaries involve your thoughts, values, and opinions. You might find it helpful to write down your thoughts and feelings about your personal boundaries.

Another way to deal with a mean teacher is to work on being positive in the classroom, instead of arguing or complaining about every little thing. Don’t spend so much time complaining that the last test was hard; instead, ask yourself if you can do better next time if you study more. Don’t talk about how Charlotte’s Web was the most boring book you’ve ever had to read; instead, focus on the parts of it you really liked. Being more positive toward your teacher will help set a more positive tone in the classroom, and it should lead your teacher to be less mean. Try to focus on the things you do like about the learning experience. Being excited about new material will make class more fun for you, and will make your teacher less likely to be mean. They will be more inclined to soften if they see that you genuinely care. Think about it: it can be pretty discouraging for your teacher to teach something they are really excited about, only to get groans and eye rolls in response. Of course that would encourage meanness.\\n2. Though you may think that your teacher is the meanest person in the world, you should try having some compassion to see if there may be something more going on. Try to think about why your teacher is being “mean” and if this is because your teacher feels disrespected in the classroom. Maybe all of the students are mean, maybe many of them don’t take the material seriously, or maybe a handful of students are so disruptive that it’s impossible to learn. Your teacher may be “mean” because they feel like there’s no other way to get people to listen. Putting yourself in another person’s shoes is a skill that can be useful for the rest of your life. Developing empathy and compassion can help you in social and work situations for the rest of your life. Learning to step outside yourself can help you see a situation in a new light and solve problems. You should tell them how you feel. Of course, it can be hard to see your teacher as anyone other than a mean person who is getting you down, but you should remember that they're only human, too.\\n3. Figuring out what motivates your teacher can really help you deal with them. If your teacher is being mean because no one is participating, then try to speak up more in class. If your teacher is mean because they feel disrespected, then try to stop laughing at them behind their back. If they're mean because no one is paying attention, then make an extra effort to answer their questions and to put away any distractions. Giving them what they want can help them become less mean. Believe it or not, but everyone has a soft spot. Maybe your teacher is really into cats. Doing something as simple as telling them about your cat or asking to see pictures of theirs can make them open up to you a bit. Even giving your teacher a real compliment, like saying you like a new poster on the wall, can help motivate your teacher to be nice if they take a lot of pride in their classroom.\\n4. v4-460px-Make-the-Teacher-Think-You-Are-Smart-Step-6.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Write-a-Good-Economics-Essay-Step-8-Version-2.jpg\", 'question_id': 104947, 'answer_choices': [[5, 3, 4, 2, 0, 1], [0, 2, 4, 5, 3, 1], [0, 4, 1, 3, 2, 5], [2, 5, 1, 0, 3, 4]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1049551.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. In Hindi, no is written नहीं. No is pronounced nahin and the pronunciation is soft. The emphasis is on the na at the beginning of the word, and the n is nasal. Yes in Hindi is pronounced haa and is spelled हाँ. Hindi is the second most spoken language in the world. 370 million people speak Hindi as their native language and 120 million speak it as a second language. It is an official language in Fiji and India. To say no more politely, add ji to the beginning or end of nahi. This is the same for yes, haa. Although Hindi is the official language of India, there are 22 major languages and 720 dialects spoken in India. A quote that says no in Hindi is, जल में रहकर मगर से बैर ठीक नहीं which translates to you should not have enmity with the crocodile if you are living in the water and means that you should strive to have good relationships with the people you have to live or work with. There are 3 stylistic varieties of Hindi: one used in high courts, journalism, literature, philosophy and religion; another Persianized version that is used in lower courts, films and some genres of literature; and a third Anglicized version for business administration, colleges, and science and technical journals.\\n1. v4-460px-Say-No-in-Various-Languages-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Say-No-in-Various-Languages-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Say-No-in-Various-Languages-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n4.

Afrikaans evolved from a mixture of Dutch and other languages including Bantu, Khoisan languages, and English.

It’s best to do this before opening the remote. Some of the buttons may come flying out when you open it. Use your phone or draw a diagram if you don’t have a user manual with one in it. Also, note and document the position of any screws on the remote. The solution used to fix on the remote takes some time to dry. Forgetting the button positioning is very easy when you’re forced to wait before putting it back together. Fortunately, you will have a handy picture to make it easier! Putting back the screws can also be confusing, so make sure you have pictures of all of them and know where they belong.\\n1. All remotes are different, so taking them apart isn’t always a straightforward process. Most of them have a couple of screws in the back. Use a mini Phillips screwdriver to turn the screws counterclockwise until you’re able to remove them. If you don’t see any screws on the back, check the battery compartment and also look underneath any stickers or sliding covers. Some remotes may not have any visible screws. These types of removes usually just need to be pried open with a dull blade. Be cautious when removing the screws.

Learn shorthand to take handwritten notes faster. Using shorthand can increase your writing speed and means that you will spend more time listening in the meeting rather than writing. If you don’t have time or patience for learning shorthand, you can also use abbreviations or marks that mean something to you.

Make sure the ink of whatever pen you choose dries quickly so it does not smear on the page of the book.\\n2. v4-460px-Sign-a-Book-Step-2.jpg\\n3. v4-460px-Sign-a-Book-Step-4.jpg', 'question_id': 10497257, 'answer_choices': [[3, 2, 1, 0], [2, 3, 1, 0], [1, 2, 3, 0], [0, 2, 1, 3]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10497325.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Use a cordless drill to attach the mounting screw into the wall. Depending on what type of wall you have, you may need to use anchors to secure the screws, especially if you aren't attaching the frame to the beams behind the wall. For instance, if you’ll be installing your picture in drywall, you’ll either need to screw it into the studs or use drywall anchors to support the weight of the frame. You’ll also need to use anchors if you’re trying to hang a picture on cement or brick.\\n1. v4-460px-Decorate-Slanted-Walls-Step-8.jpg\\n2. v4-460px-Decorate-Slanted-Walls-Step-2.jpg\\n3. When you buy the fastener, it should come with a smaller screw and a larger mounting screw. Use a screwdriver or a cordless drill to attach the fastener to the frame using the smaller screw. Keyhole fasteners have a small slot with a wider opening that allows you to slide them over the mounting screws. The fastener should be placed so the wide opening is at the bottom and the narrow slot is at the top. Since you’ll need to attach the picture at all 4 corners to keep it flush to your slanted wall, being able to slide the fasteners into place will make the process much easier. These fasteners are often used for hanging mirror frames and can be found at any home improvement store. The weight load of the 4 fasteners should meet or exceed the weight of the picture. This information should be located on the packaging for the fasteners Also, make sure you choose a sturdy picture frame that won't break or splinter from being slanted.\\n4. v4-460px-Decorate-Slanted-Walls-Step-4.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Decorate-Slanted-Walls-Step-6.jpg\\n6. You don’t need much tape for this since you're just sticking the tape onto the level to mark the horizontal distance between the top 2 fasteners. A strip of masking tape that's about 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) should be sufficient. Use one piece of tape for each of the top 2 fasteners. It’s okay if the masking tape isn’t perfectly centered, but it should be wide enough to cover the entire keyhole slot in the bracket. Masking tape is easy to tear and can easily be marked with a pencil, which is why it's ideal for this project. You can buy masking tape anywhere that office supplies are sold.\\n7. Once the level is flush against the wall, look at the bubble in the center tube. If the bubble is perfectly centered on the line in the tube, the level is straight. If the bubble isn’t centered, tilt the level until it is. For the most stability, anchor the frame to one of the beams behind the wall. To do this, use a stud-finder to locate the beams, and use that to determine where you want to hang the picture.\\n8. v4-460px-Decorate-Slanted-Walls-Step-10.jpg\\n9. The easiest way to find the location for your bottom set of mounting screws is to measure the distance on the frame, then find that distance below the marks you made on the wall. Use a tape measure to get the exact distance between the keyhole cut-outs in the fastener, then write down that measurement. Your measurement should be taken from the same place on each fastener. For instance, if you measure from the very top of one hole, be sure to measure down to the very top of the second hole as well. If your fasteners are installed evenly, you should only need to take one measurement. However, it never hurts to double-check by measuring both sides.\", 'question_id': 10497325, 'answer_choices': [[0, 7, 4, 5, 6, 2, 9, 3, 8, 1], [0, 5, 4, 3, 2, 6, 8, 9, 1, 7], [3, 2, 6, 4, 7, 5, 9, 1, 0, 8], [0, 4, 2, 1, 9, 5, 6, 7, 3, 8]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/1049734.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

A urea breath test is the gold standard of diagnostic methods. It is the most accurate test for H. pylori. A stool test antigen, in which a sample is examined in a laboratory for signs of H. pylori. This is considered the second most effective. A blood test. This test reveals the presence of antibodies that fight H. pylori. It is 65 to 95% effective, making it the least reliable test. A biopsy. A tissue sample is removed from your stomach using a procedure called an endoscopy. A biopsy is usually only performed if an endoscopy is needed for other reasons such as treating an ulcer, bleeding, or making sure there is no cancer.

Birkenstock is a brand, not a style, and the shoes can be expensive, costing over $100 a pair. Other companies make less expensive knock-offs, some for as low as $25. However, real Birkenstocks are well-made and long-lasting, with special patented soles. There are a number of ways to make sure your Birkenstocks are authentic and not fake. Birkenstocks come in a Birkenstock-branded box, not a plain box or plastic bag. The logo, registered trademark, and words \"Made in Germany\" are stamped on the footbed of every shoe. Real Birkenstocks are never made in China. The Birkenstock logo also appears on the inner side of each shoe, and on every buckle and button. Knock-off Birkenstocks are heavier than the real thing, and might have clumps of glue holding the shoes together. To be sure you\\'re getting real Birkenstocks, buy them from an authorized Birkenstock retailer.\\n1. v4-460px-Wear-Birkenstocks-Step-2.jpg\\n2. These shoes with a toe piece provide a slightly more upscale alternative to the classic beachwear. You can also choose a model with a stylish loop around the big toe for a more feminine version of this look. For another take on the flip flop aesthetic, try the one strap Birkenstock models, such as the Madrid. One thick strap holds the sandal on the foot. This can mean that your foot slides around a bit more in this style than in ones with more straps.\\n3. v4-460px-Wear-Birkenstocks-Step-4.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Wear-Birkenstocks-Step-6.jpg\\n5. Some Birkenstock models, like the Granada and the Bali, come with laser cut-outs in the straps. This gives them a more delicate, elegant feel. These styles are also more feminine.\\n6. There are over 300 models, colors, and textures of Birkenstocks, so you will be able to find a shade that fits your style. Don\\'t be afraid to experiment! Neutral colors like black, brown, and white are the most versatile, since they can be paired with any outfit. Black in particular is always flattering, and can be worn in every season.

You can easily lure ladybugs by attracting the pests that they like to eat such as aphids, mites, and scale.

Beyond your undergraduate and graduate degrees, technical certifications can indicate to employers that you have mastered specific technical skills. The type of certifications you should seek will vary depending on your specific field of focus. Ask others in the field whether technical certifications in various programming languages, information security, or systems design might be most beneficial. Technical certifications often involve taking classes and passing an exam to prove your proficiency. Most certification courses charge a fee, but before enrolling check with your current company to see whether the cost could be covered through a professional development plan. Before you break the bank on loads of certifications, however, keep in mind that technical certificates alone won’t land you a new job or promotion.

One of the best ways to get to know and understand any person is to talk to them. If you’re interested in understanding more about a woman, ask her questions. Just don’t make the questions too personal or invasive, especially if you don’t know her very well. For example, you might ask her things like:\\n“What do you like to do for fun?”\\n“How do you feel about this issue?”\\n“Why did you decide to go into that profession?”\\n“What are some things you hope to accomplish one day?”\\n1. v4-460px-Understand-Women-Step-6-Version-4.jpg\\n2. You’ll have a hard time understanding any person if you assume that you know everything (or anything!) about them. When you’re getting to know a woman, start by letting go of any assumptions about what she is thinking or feeling. Don’t jump to the conclusion that you know anything about her life, preferences, or core beliefs. For example, if she’s single, don’t assume that she’s lonely and looking for a relationship. Not all women are interested in being with a romantic partner. It can be hard to recognize your own assumptions. If you find yourself thinking something about a woman in your life, stop and ask yourself: “Why do I think that? Is there any reason for me to believe that about her?”\\n3. If you’re having trouble understanding someone’s behavior, sometimes it can help to talk to her other friends or acquaintances. They might be able to shed light on why she acts, thinks, or talks the way she does. For example, you could say, “You’ve known Sarah for a long time. Why does she get so annoyed whenever the topic of parrots comes up?”\\n4. v4-460px-Understand-Women-Step-8-Version-4.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Understand-Women-Step-4-Version-4.jpg\\n6. Listening to someone’s words isn’t the only way to understand them. It’s also important to pay attention to her non-verbal cues, like her facial expressions and posture. When you’re spending time with a woman or conversing with her, watch what her face and body are doing. For example, if she’s making eye contact, smiling, and letting her arms hang at her sides, she’s probably feeling comfortable and relaxed. If she’s looking at the floor and crossing her arms, she may feel nervous, shy, or preoccupied.\\n7. v4-460px-Understand-Women-Step-2-Version-4.jpg\\n8. Even if you live in a society where the genders are legally and socially considered equal, men and women deal with their own unique problems and challenges. To understand individual women, try to look at the big picture and understand what kinds of pressures and biases they deal with that you don’t. For example, you might read articles, books, or opinion pieces about issues such as the differences in how men and women are treated by medical personnel or the challenges that women face in the workplace. If a woman complains about the challenges and frustrations of being female, resist the urge to get defensive or dismissive.

My stomach is churning, my throat feels tight, and my muscles feel tensed. I feel like I need to cry it out so I can relax again.\"\\n6. Replacing negative, angry thoughts with humorous ones can help stop the flow of tears when you’re feeling angry. Conjure up an image or memory in your mind that makes you want to laugh out loud. Focus on this imagery or situation to curb your tears. Try thinking about the funniest moment you can remember in your life. Replay the series of events in your mind.

You probably know the person well enough to pinpoint one of their favorite hobbies or interests, but if you aren't that close to them, don't be afraid to ask someone who would know! Finding decorations that match a very specific or obscure interest may not be feasible at your local craft store, so try looking online instead.

If the person loves Harry Potter or Star Wars, you could go with decorations that reflect those interests.

For example, for a first birthday, the décor and party favors can feature the number “1” or say “Happy 1st Birthday!” on them. The cake and Mylar balloons can be shaped like the number “1,” as well. You can also base color choices on the age. For example, a Sweet 16 party can be decorated in shades of pink.

Your packing should be arranged with respects to the weekend's activity and the environment it's taking place in. Because your trip will only encompass a couple of days, it's prudent to check the weather forecast for those days and plan accordingly. If there's going to be rain, the clothes you bring should reflect that. A poncho and umbrella will be sorely missed if you neglect to check the weather beforehand. In the case of sun, bringing sunglasses and sunscreen will be helpful. Cold weather demands you bring heavier clothing, like a winter parka, along for the ride. If you're somehow unsure, prepare for the worst just in case. Even if your weekend trip will be spent mostly indoors, bringing an umbrella can make a major difference in the case of rain.

You don't want to skimp out on things you might miss, but optional luxuries like a hair dryer can probably be done without over a 48 hour period. For a weekend trip, try to limit yourself to a single backpack forth of clothing and items. This will force you to prioritize what you need over the things you can do without.

You will want to feel fresh on the second and third day of being away from home, and in the case that your first set of clothes gets wet or dirty, you'll want something to fall back on. The same applies to socks and underwear. Bring heavier clothing, like a jacket, based on the forecasted weather. Toiletries. Toothpaste and a toothbrush should be deemed essential for your trip. If the place you're going has running water, a small vial of shampoo and conditioner should be brought along as well to ensure you're feeling fresh throughout the trip. Trip entertainment. The journey to and from your location should be just as enjoyable as when you get there. This can be helped by taking along some entertainment. If you're driving, bring a few of your favourite CDs to cycle through. A good book is also recommended, particularly if you're going somewhere relaxing like a lake. Trip-applicable items. A weekend vacation is often built around a certain activity. Your to-bring list should mention the specific things you'll need to perform that activity. If you're fishing, for example, you will need a rod and a bait box, among other things. Depending on where you're going, items like some mild first aid should be considered as well.\\n4. v4-460px-Pack-for-Vacation-Step-4-Version-3.jpg\", 'question_id': 1050592, 'answer_choices': [[3, 1, 0, 2, 4], [3, 4, 2, 1, 0], [3, 2, 0, 4, 1], [2, 0, 3, 1, 4]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10506220.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Some thermometers are meant for candy and other types of food. Be sure you have a thermometer meant for meat to get the most accurate reading.\\n1. The thickest part of the steak is what has been cooked the least, so this is the best reading to take if you want to know if it’s done. To do this, insert the thermometer into the side of the steak until it is in the thickest part of the meat (usually the center). If you are cooking steak on the bone, make sure the thermometer isn’t touching the bone when you take the reading. Bone is an excellent heat conductor, so it’s usually hotter than the rest of the meat. If you’re not sure you’re in the thickest part, try poking the thermometer all the way through to the other side first. As you pull it slowly back out, the temperature will rise as the tip of the thermometer enters the meat again, and then gradually drop as you get closer and closer to the center. The lowest temperature you see is the number you should go by.\\n2. Remember that your steak will continue to cook even after you take it off the pan or grill. This means you will want to remove it from the heat when the thermometer reads 5 degrees below your goal temperature.\\n3. v4-459px-Tell-if-Steak-Is-Done-Step-2.jpg\\n4. v4-459px-Tell-if-Steak-Is-Done-Step-4.jpg', 'question_id': 10506220, 'answer_choices': [[1, 4, 0, 2, 3], [1, 0, 3, 2, 4], [1, 3, 0, 4, 2], [0, 3, 1, 4, 2]], 'answer_id': 3}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10507124.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0.

When you smile, it presents you to the world in a very non-threatening and helpful way. People will respond much more positively to a person who is smiling than someone who is not.

When speaking to a customer or co-worker, eye contact is essential to help maintain a good rapport between you and evoke positive reactions from them. Eye contact shows interest, respect, and intelligence, and helps to combat people's perceptions that you might be rude, shy, or introverted. Not making eye contact can additionally make you appear distracted or nervous. Focus on making eye contact especially when someone else is speaking to you, or when you would like to connect with your audience during presentations.\\n5.

It's very normal to feel sad after you retire. You should not expect to go into retirement with elation right away. There will be an adjustment period in which you grieve the loss of  your job and livelihood. This is normal. Try to allow yourself to feel what you are feeling without judgment. If you've been settled into a career for awhile, chances are your job is more than just a job. It provides you with a sense of fulfillment each day. Your social life is likely connected to your work life. While you may not miss the schedule and demands, you may miss the social connections and sense of meaning you gained from work. Remind yourself that it's okay and normal to be sad. Most people who retire experience some level of sadness initially. Allow yourself to feel what you're feeling, good or bad, in the wake of retirement. Keep in mind emotions are not permanent. While you may dislike feelings of sadness you experience, do not expect them to last forever.\\n1. v4-460px-Adjust-to-Retirement-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\\n2. Many people have high expectations going into retirement. You may think you will now have time to do all those things you put off due to your work schedule. However, not working can be stressful. The emotional toll of retirement may prevent you from diving into the plans you've made. Make a list of what you can reasonably expect to do in the weeks or months following your retirement. Try not to stack your list with too much. Even with your newfound free time, it takes awhile to get into a new project. Remind yourself you're not going to complete all your post-retirement plans within your first six months. Allow yourself to adjust. You may see retirement as your chance to finally read War and Peace, but you may not feel like doing much reading right away. You may need some time to adjust emotionally before taking on new projects or pursuits.\\n3. v4-460px-Adjust-to-Retirement-Step-6-Version-2.jpg\\n4. Retirement provides you with an invaluable opportunity to reflect on your past. Try to look back on the trajectory of your life. Reflect on past moments. An increased understanding and appreciation for the past can help you understand yourself, making the transition into retirement smoother. You will be spending a lot of time alone with your thoughts in retirement, so being okay with yourself and your choices is important. Go through old photo albums or family movies to spur memories. Pause as you browse old albums and videos, trying to put yourself back in the moment and savor the memory. Ask yourself questions as you consider the past. Why did you make the choices you made? Are you happy with how you spent your time? If there's anything you feel you missed out on, retirement could give you an opportunity to pursue it. Reminisce with others. Call up an old friend or family member and talk about the past. If you have family or friends in town, make plans to get coffee or drinks and talk about the past.\\n5. v4-460px-Adjust-to-Retirement-Step-4-Version-2.jpg\\n6. If you are married, retirement can change your relationship. Couples can become stressed when neither party has a fixed schedule. Prepare for changes in your marriage ahead of time to reduce potential tension. Form a mutually acceptable plan for your future. You both likely have plans you want to pursue in retirement. What plans can you do together? What plans should you pursue on your own? Decide how much time you want to spend together. While doing activities together is important, it's also important to have some alone time. Talk about the little things as well. You may be looking forward to sleeping in each day as long as you want. Your spouse, however, may want to keep getting up early to maintain some schedule. Find a way to compromise. Maybe you can sleep in three days a week, but agree to get up the other four. Avoid codependency. If your partner did not work, that person may have a social life and schedule of his or her own. Try not to infringe on your partner's time.

Despite the SMF being akin to the Loch Ness Monster or Bigfoot — rumored but never proven to exist — there are some formatting guidelines that are practically universal and should always be followed. Use all black text on all white paper. No funky, unique, or \"pretty\" colors of any kind. Also use a good-quality, 20-pound bond white paper if making a hard copy submission. Don’t staple the paper, and pack it neatly and securely for shipping. Make the manuscript readable by choosing a traditional, 12-point font and double-spacing everything. No big letters, no cramped pages to save trees / shipping costs, no Comic Sans font. There is some disagreement on the best traditional font, but Times New Roman, Courier, and possibly Arial are the best bets. Create margins that allow the editor room to scribble notes on the pages. One-inch (2.54 cm, or just 3 cm) margins all around is the typical standard. You can go a bit bigger if desired, but there is no reason to have giant margins and a small text area in the center. Every page of text should have a header with your last name, the manuscript title (or just key words from it), and the page number. Commonly this is placed on the right margin. Some recommend using hyphens or spaces, but slashes are typical as such:  Smith / My Manuscript / 23. Unless told otherwise, left align your text, leaving a jagged right edge (don’t “justify” the text). This is considered more readable by most. If you\\'re submitting electronically, save your manuscript as a PDF unless specifically told otherwise.

Editors have huge piles of submitted manuscripts — well, nowadays, perhaps countless email attachments — to read through at any one time. You might think that flashy colors, unique fonts, or some other eye-catching effort might make your manuscript stand out, but they usually prefer a “boring” standardized look that allows them to quickly examine and assess the work. For each publisher to which you submit your manuscript, check to see if they have specific formatting guidelines, and follow them if so. Guidelines will often be posted on the publisher\\'s website, but if you aren\\'t sure, you can contact a person in the acquisitions department for clarification. In absence of publisher guidelines, however, using the general guidelines here should work. Usually, if your formatting is common, simple, and consistent, your manuscript’s odds of immediately landing on the “reject” pile will be reduced.', 'question_id': 1050943, 'answer_choices': [[2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 2], [1, 2, 0]], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10509475.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. Use the base of the cup to pull downward toward your vaginal opening. As the cup begins to come out, reposition your fingers to get a better grip and to prevent any spillage.

Simply acknowledging that Jesus is the Son of God and he died for our sins isn’t enough to get you into heaven. You have to make a conscious decision to become a follower of Jesus, praying to God for forgiveness for your sins. This is known in Christianity as being “born again,” because your life should be different from that moment forward. In John 3:3, the Bible explicitly states that you can not go to heaven without doing this: \"Jesus answered to him, \\'Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.\\'\"\\n3. Everyone has sinned, or done something wrong, and those sins separate you from God. In the Old Testament of the Bible, people were commanded to make animal sacrifices in order to be forgiven for their sins. However, the New Testament says that God sent His son Jesus to Earth to be killed as the ultimate sacrifice, so that all people could be forgiven if they accepted him. The Bible also says that Jesus was raised from the dead 3 days after he was killed, proving his divine nature. John 3:16 describes God’s gift to mankind: “For God so loved the world, that He gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.”\\nRomans 5:8 describes the sacrifice Jesus made for sinners: \"But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\"', 'question_id': 1051071, 'answer_choices': [[2, 3, 1, 0], [1, 2, 3, 0], [3, 0, 2, 1], [3, 1, 0, 2]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10511150.jpg', 'question': \"Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Become-Successful-in-Your-Network-Marketing-Business-and-Have-Fun-Step-5.jpg\\n1.

Chlorine is necessary for any pool owner, but there are a few options on how to administer the chlorine. You can administer chlorine manually or you can invest in a salt water system that creates its own chlorine. Salt water pools are more expensive, but require less maintenance and use safer chlorine levels than regular pools. If you go with a salt water system, you can avoid doing much of what is discussed below.\\n3. For your first time purchasing pool chemicals, go to a pool supply store and talk to a specialist. These are serious chemicals that could cause problems for your pool goers' health. Find an all inclusive starter kit that includes chlorine, calcium, alkalinity stabilizer, and algaecide. You can also substitute chlorine with bromine. Bromine tablets are reliable in killing bacteria and keeping your pool clear.\\n4. All pools use a motorized pool cleaner and they come in three different types. Use the following information to decide on which is best for you and your pool:\\nSuction side pool cleaners are low in cost, require fewer moving parts, and are easy to maintain. The only problem is they increase pressure on your filter and require a pool pump. Pressure side pool cleaners are similar to the suction cleaner expect they relieve pressure on the pool filter. The only problem with these is that they sometimes require an extra booster pump. Robotic cleaners offer superior cleaning, energy efficiency, and eliminates the wear on your pool.

After you’ve apologized, let your partner say their piece. They may be sad, disappointed, or angry with you. Although it might be painful to hear them express these feelings, it’s important to acknowledge their emotions and let them know you are hearing their concerns. Don’t interrupt your partner while they are speaking. Even if what they have to say upsets you, wait for them to finish before you respond. Show that you are listening by using verbal and visual cues (such as making eye contact, nodding, and saying things like “Right,” or “I understand.”).\\n1. If your partner confronts you about a lie, resist the impulse to get defensive or to justify your actions. Trying to deny the lie or make excuses will ultimately undermine your partner’s trust in you even more. No matter what your reasons may have been, take full ownership of your actions—admit the lie and don’t try to place the blame on anyone else. For example, you might say, “You’re right. I know I told you I wasn’t going to smoke anymore, but I gave in to temptation and had a couple cigarettes last night when I was out with my friends. I was afraid of what you’d think, so I lied about it when you asked me.”\\nIdeally, you should own up to your lie before your partner finds out about it.

US law requires your bank or credit card company to at least acknowledge your complaint and initiate an investigation within 30 days of your call.

In any event, they cannot take longer than 90 days under consumer protection laws. Keep in mind that resolving a complaint does not necessarily mean that they find in your favor or refund your money.

You'll be more believable if you have detailed information about your interactions with the scammers to back up your story. For example, if the scammer contacted you through email, print copies of the emails so you have them for reference. However, do not delete the original emails and rely solely on printed copies. The emails have information in the headers that may be useful for investigators attempting to find the scammers. If the scammer contacted you in other ways, such as through the mail, through text messages, or on social media, make copies of those messages as well. As with emails, save the originals. Compile a chronology of your interactions with the scammers and specific amounts of money transferred. You can use receipts, bank records, or credit card statements for this. Include any information you have about the location of the scammers, even if you doubt its accuracy.\\n4. Remain calm, and describe the facts of the scam in chronological order. Be as detailed as possible, including the date and amount of the transaction. If there were multiple transactions, be prepared to explain why you sent the scammers more money. Take the name and any identification number of the customer service representative you talk to. Ask if they have a direct number so you can talk to them again if necessary. If you have physical documentation, find out how you can submit it. Request written confirmation of the conversation be mailed to you.

Although bright colors and fun patterns may sound great in theory, you should look for colors and patterns that will stand the test of time. When you are in the market for furniture, look for items that will last you many years and won’t need replacing - especially with color. Choose a good neutral tone for the majority of your furniture, and then opt to have one or two pieces in a color or pattern you enjoy. This way, you’ll stand a better chance of still loving your furniture years down the road as your style changes.\\n2. v4-459px-Buy-Furniture-Step-2.jpg\\n3. Start out on the right foot by measuring your room and the ideal size of the furniture you’re looking for. Although you may think that you can just ‘eye’ it, you may end up making a colossal purchasing mistake and buying something much too large or too small. When you have your exact measurements, you’ll be more focused in your search and less likely to purchase something that won’t really work.\\n4. If you’re heading to Ikea, you are probably focused on low prices more than high quality. If, however, you are investing in a solid piece(s) of furniture you hope to last many years, then you should pay close attention to the quality. Wood furniture comes in three makes: solid, veneer, and plywood/particleboard. Solid wood is what you want; it may cost a bit more but, as the name suggest, it is 100% good quality, solid wood. Veneer is a core of plywood coated in higher quality wood, while plywood is compressed sawdust and wood bits. If you’re looking for upholstered furniture, check the quality of the springs in the base, the substance of the stuffing, and the structure of the support system. If you can, look for sofas with a fifth leg in the center to give better support. Hardwoods come from deciduous trees, while softwoods come from coniferous trees; the name has no bearing on the actual hardness or softness of the wood. If the furniture squeaks or makes noise, it’s not very good quality and should be avoided. If the furniture is primarily assembled with nails and glue, avoid it. Screws and dowels are the best for good quality furniture.

If you don't have a front-loading machine, you can still wash your pillows, but you'll need to run a gentle cycle. This is because top-loading machines are rougher as they agitate the pillows. It's important to balance the load in the top-loading machine so it spins effectively. If you put a pillow around one half of the drum, put another pillow on the opposite side or fill that side with the same amount of laundry.\\n7.

Although you want people to see you as the cool guy, the best way to be un-awesome is to constantly ask for other people\\'s approval. This type of behavior makes you look needy. Instead of wondering if other people like you, decide if you like yourself. It\\'s natural to care about what others think of you. However, you can\\'t please everyone all the time, and sometimes your personality will clash with other people\\'s, and they just won\\'t like you. Instead of trying to please everyone, consider who is in your life that really matters to you, such as your mom or dad, grandparent, or best friend. If the people closest to you like and love you, it\\'s easier to dismiss the opinions of those who don\\'t. For instance, say someone who is not on your list of people who really matter (a guy at school who isn\\'t a close friend, for instance) insults you or speaks badly about you behind your back. Consider, very briefly, what that person said. Is there any truth to it? Likely, there isn\\'t, so just dismiss it by reminding yourself that this is not a person whose opinion matters. If you are a person who craves affirmation through social media, consider limiting your time on facebook and instagram or suspending your account. \"Likes\" and \"hearts\" aren\\'t an accurate measure of your awesomeness.\\n1. The most awesome people do what they love and don\\'t apologize for it. Do you love art, books, music, or sports? Whatever it is, do it! Very cool people have something that they do really well. Once you find your passion, work toward being the best. Maybe your passion is basketball, but you can never make the three-pointer. Practice at this until you can do it with your eyes closed! People will come to know you as “that awesome guy who scores all the three-pointers!”\\nShare what you love with others. For instance, if you like reading, start a book club.

Before you begin writing the essay, use an outline to plan out what you want to say in each of your paragraphs. Number your paragraphs 1–3 and jot down a phrase or sentence that sums up the major point you want to make in that paragraph. Also write down what secondary sources—if any—you’ll use in each paragraph. If you write the essay without outlining, the essay will be poorly organized.\\n1. Start the paragraph by making a specific statement about the topic of the essay, so your argument can be sharpened and clarified from there. Concisely explain what the essay will discuss and why the topic is important. Also give readers an example of the type of evidence you’ll use to prove your point. Situate the thesis statement as the second or third sentence in your introductory paragraph, so readers will grasp your main point immediately. So, avoid beginning the paragraph by writing something like, “Since the beginning of time, all people have been consumed with the desire for their father’s approval.”\\nInstead, write something like, “In the play Death of a Salesman, Willie Loman’s sons compete for their father’s approval through various masculine displays.\" Then, you can say, \"To examine this topic, I will perform a close reading of several key passages of the play and present analyses by noted Arthur Miller scholars.\"\\n2. Every paragraph should contain and prove 1 main idea. You can prove the paragraphs\\' claim with a combination of quotes and citations from primary and secondary sources and your own thoughts and analyses. Keep in mind that all of the claims you make should work to prove your thesis in one way or another. So, take the example about Death of a Salesman. The first body paragraph could discuss the ways in which Willie’s sons try to impress him. The second body paragraph could dive into Willie’s hopelessness and despair, and the third paragraph could discuss how Miller uses his characters to show the flaws in their understanding of the American Dream.\\n3. v4-460px-Write-a-Short-Essay-Step-7.jpg\\n4. v4-460px-Write-a-Short-Essay-Step-9.jpg\\n5. v4-460px-Write-a-Short-Essay-Step-5.jpg\\n6. v4-460px-Write-a-Short-Essay-Step-11.jpg\\n7.

If no one agrees to read the essay, read over your own first draft and look for errors or spots where you could clarify your meaning.

Floss can get in between the teeth and remove food that a toothbrush just can’t get. When flossing, use about 18 inches (46 cm) of floss, hold it between your thumb and forefinger in each hand, and insert it between your teeth using a rubbing motion. Once between your teeth, wrap it in a “c” shape against each of the teeth it is between and rub the area gently.

Before you begin the process of applying for Medicaid, it’s advisable to learn about the program. This may help you in the application process or even help you better understand the types of benefits for which you are eligible. Medicaid and its partner program CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program) give almost 60 million American some type of health coverage. Medicaid and CHIP cover a wide range of individuals including children, pregnant women, parents, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities. Although a federal program, individual states handle Medicaid applications and programs. Federal law requires that states cover certain population groups called “mandatory eligibility groups” while giving the states the option to cover other groups called “optional eligibility groups.” For example, pregnant women, people with disabilities, and children are considered mandatory groups. Optional groups include foster children and low income families.\\n3. It is easy to be confused by questions about Medicaid and its eligibility. If you have any questions, you can contact local authorities or consult the Medicaid program’s website, who may be able to further assist you. You can either visit the Medicaid website at www.medicaid.gov or visit your home state’s Medicaid website. In most cases, you can also find state resources on the Medicaid website at http://www.medicaid.gov/state-resource-center/medicaid-state-technical-assistance/medicaid-state-technical-assistance.html . You can also contact or visit one of the ten regional Centers for Medicare and Medicare if you have questions. Information on these ten sites is available at https://www.cms.gov/About-CMS/Agency-Information/RegionalOffices/index.html\\n\\nIf you do not have access to the Internet from your home or prefer to speak to someone directly, you can call +1 (877) 267-2323.\\n4. In addition to the aforementioned basic requirements, there are many other criteria that you generally need meet to qualify for Medicaid. These criteria may include but are not limited to:\\nYour income. Income is measured against the Federal Poverty Level, or FPL. This number changes frequently, but was $29,700 for a family of four in 2011. Pregnancy. Age. If you are 65 or older or are under the age of 21, you may qualify. Disability, including blindness. Current coverage or lack thereof. Children in your household.

Eating excessive sweets and fatty foods increases your risk for pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes development. You can reverse high-normal blood sugar (pre-diabetes) and reduce your risk for Type 2 Diabetes by reducing unhealthy foods, watching your portions, and eating a balanced diet.\\n1. v4-460px-Avoid-Type-2-Diabetes-Step-4.jpg\\n2. One of the leading sources of empty calories and excess sugar is drinking sugar-laden beverages such as sodas and “juice drinks” with limited juice content. You should aim to quench your thirst with water most of the time. If you're worried about its quality, purchase a filter. If you are accustomed to drinking sugary drinks, your body will crave sweetened drinks initially until you wean yourself from the habit. Sodas, soft drinks, fruit juice, cordial, fruit drinks, flavored water, energy drinks, etc., are all sources of invisible sugar that your body does not need. Leave these drinks for treats only and rely on drinking water and milk. If you get tired of plain water, soda water and sparkling mineral water are free of sugar, and a few drops of freshly-squeezed lemon or orange juice can be sufficient to flavor these drinks pleasantly. Coffee and unsweetened tea can also be enjoyed in moderation.\\n3. It may seem like punishment to cut all sugar out of your life forever. However, you can still indulge in the foods you like from time to time without derailing all of your eating habits. You may even find that saving your favorite sweet treats for special occasions, rather than indulging in them daily, can make the experience of eating the treats even sweeter.\\n4. Replace sugary snacks with fruit, vegetable sticks, nuts, and other healthy items. Fresh, seasonal fruit can satisfy a craving for something sweet. Salted nuts can be a good substitute for salty snacks like chips, but they provide increased nutrients like of fiber, healthy fat, and protein.\\n5. v4-460px-Avoid-Type-2-Diabetes-Step-2.jpeg\\n6. If you are pre-diabetic, you may need to avoid eating anything other than a light protein snack near bedtime. You should also limit your beverage consumption to water only, cutting out alcohol or drinks with sugar or caffeine. If you feel hungry after dinner, try eating a low calorie and carbohydrate food that will have less of an impact on your blood sugar. Some options include:Celery sticks\\nBaby carrots\\nGreen bell pepper slices\\nA handful of cranberries\\nFour almonds (or similar nuts),\\nA cup of light or air-popped popcorn\\n7. v4-460px-Avoid-Type-2-Diabetes-Step-8.jpeg\\n8. v4-460px-Avoid-Type-2-Diabetes-Step-6.jpeg\\n9. v4-460px-Avoid-Type-2-Diabetes-Step-12.jpeg\\n10.

There are a variety of different reasons someone asks you to write a progress report. Obviously for any of them it's to show what kind of progress you've achieved on a specific project. However, there are some different types of proposals that you'll need to consider. Progress report for a research program or project is going to be slightly different than for a project at work. In this case you are more likely to need to cite information and are less likely to need to consider things like cost (although not always).

While you may be tempted to go with the longest lashes, if you don’t have very strong natural lashes, they won’t be able to support the heavier length and the extensions will fall off faster. If you have weaker or lighter lashes, ask for a length between .002 and .003 inches (0.051 and 0.076 mm) to be safe. To determine the strength of your lashes, feel if they're brittle to the touch or notice if they fall out or break off often. These are both signs you have weak lashes. Extensions can go up to .5 inches (13 mm) long. A good rule of thumb is to choose ones that are about .08 inches (2.0 mm) longer than your natural lashes to prevent fallout. The stylist can measure your lashes for you, or you can buy an eyelash measurement ruler from a beauty store or online retailer. How long do extensions typically last? If cared for properly, lash extensions should last 4 to 6 weeks. Many salons recommend getting touch-ups or refills around 3 weeks, though, especially if you notice gaps or pieces falling out.\\n2. Choosing extensions in a material that's too heavy for your natural lashes will cause them to break off more easily. Eyelash extensions are typically synthetic, silk, or mink. Synthetic lashes are the heaviest, so they’re best for people who have thick, strong natural lashes, while silk lashes are very light and fine. If you aren’t sure which material is best for you, think about your hair or skin type. People with fairer skin often have finer hair, so they might choose to use silk lashes, for example. Mink lashes tend to work on everyone, no matter what your natural lashes are like. However, they’re also the most expensive, and can cost over $100.\", 'question_id': 10524081, 'answer_choices': [[2, 0, 1], [2, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2], [2, 0, 1]], 'answer_id': 2}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/VGSI/Combined_Images/10524166.jpg', 'question': 'Choose the correct order of the events? 0. v4-460px-Cement-a-Post-in-the-Ground-Step-4.jpg\\n1. v4-460px-Cement-a-Post-in-the-Ground-Step-2.jpg\\n2. Many yards have utility lines for electricity, plumbing, or gas running underneath them. Contact your local utility companies 2-3 days before you plan on digging your post to see if there are any lines running underneath the area. If you’re in the United States, you can call 811 a few days before you dig so utility companies can come mark where they have lines.\\n3. Hold your post hole diggers so the handles are together and the jaws are open. Press the jaws into the ground and pull the handles apart to clamp the soil. Turn the diggers to cut out a circle, and lift the soil out of the ground. Continue digging the hole until you reach a depth equal to ⅓ of the post’s above-ground height plus 6 inches (15 cm). For example, if you want a 6 ft (1.8 m) post, your hole should be 30 inches (76 cm) deep.', 'question_id': 10524166, 'answer_choices': [[0, 1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3, 0], [0, 3, 2, 1], [2, 0, 3, 1]], 'answer_id': 1}]}\n"

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
