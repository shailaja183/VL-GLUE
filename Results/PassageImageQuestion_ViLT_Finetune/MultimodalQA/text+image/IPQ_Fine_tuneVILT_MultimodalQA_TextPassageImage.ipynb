Bowie\\'s own interpretation of the character evolved throughout his career. \"Space Oddity\" (1969) depicts an astronaut who casually slips the bonds of the world to journey beyond the stars. In the song \"Ashes to Ashes\" (1980), Bowie reinterprets Major Tom as an oblique autobiographical symbol for himself. Major Tom is described as a \"junkie, strung out in heavens high, hitting an all-time low\". This lyric was interpreted as a play on the title of Bowie\\'s album Low (1977), which charted his withdrawal following his drug abuse in the United States. Additionally, the choked and self-recriminating tone used in the lyrics \"Time and again I tell myself I\\'ll stay clean tonight.\" reinforces an autobiographical and retrospective interpretation.

The first underground line opened on October 27, 1904, almost 35 years after the opening of the first elevated line in New York City, which became the IRT Ninth Avenue Line. By the time the first subway opened, the lines had been consolidated into two privately owned systems, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT, later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, BMT) and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT). Many present lines were built under the Dual Contracts, and after 1913, all lines built for the IRT and most other lines built or improved for the BRT were built by the city and leased to the companies. The first line of the city-owned and operated Independent Subway System (IND) opened in 1932; this system was intended to compete with the private systems and allow some of the elevated railways to be torn down, but kept within the core of the City due to the low amount of startup capital provided to the municipal Board of Transportation, the later MTA, by the state. This required it to be run \"at cost\", necessitating fares up to double the five-cent fare popular at the time.

After beating the Vikings and Falcons the Eagles advanced to Super Bowl XXXIX, where they dueled the New England Patriots. Although McNabb threw 3 touchdown passes and 357 yards in the game, and the score was tied 14–14 going into the fourth quarter, the Patriots outscored the Eagles and scored ten straight points. McNabb completed a 30-yard touchdown pass, and the Eagles defense held the Patriots to a 3 and out, but a crucial interception with 46 seconds left on the clock secured their fate.

A layer of plasticine is placed immediately after the board to detect this occurrence. An official (similar to a referee) will also watch the jump and make the determination. The competitor can initiate the jump from any point behind the foul line; however, the distance measured will always be perpendicular to the foul line to the nearest break in the sand caused by any part of the body or uniform. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the competitor to get as close to the foul line as possible. Competitors are allowed to place two marks along the side of the runway in order to assist them to jump accurately.

Bowie\\'s own interpretation of the character evolved throughout his career. \"Space Oddity\" (1969) depicts an astronaut who casually slips the bonds of the world to journey beyond the stars. In the song \"Ashes to Ashes\" (1980), Bowie reinterprets Major Tom as an oblique autobiographical symbol for himself. Major Tom is described as a \"junkie, strung out in heavens high, hitting an all-time low\". This lyric was interpreted as a play on the title of Bowie\\'s album Low (1977), which charted his withdrawal following his drug abuse in the United States. Additionally, the choked and self-recriminating tone used in the lyrics \"Time and again I tell myself I\\'ll stay clean tonight.\" reinforces an autobiographical and retrospective interpretation.

In 2004, the Philadelphia Eagles had their best season since 1960, going 13–1 before resting their starters and losing their next 2, clinching the 1st seed for the second year in a row. McNabb set career highs, completing 64% of his passes for 3,875 yards, though he didn't play all 16 games. McNabb became the first quarterback ever to throw more than 30 touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions in a season. His success could be attributed to the fact that he had a reliable receiver, Terrell Owens, who got 1,200 yards and 14 touchdowns in 14 games. After beating the Vikings and Falcons the Eagles advanced to Super Bowl XXXIX, where they dueled the New England Patriots. Although McNabb threw 3 touchdown passes and 357 yards in the game, and the score was tied 14–14 going into the fourth quarter, the Patriots outscored the Eagles and scored ten straight points. McNabb completed a 30-yard touchdown pass, and the Eagles defense held the Patriots to a 3 and out, but a crucial interception with 46 seconds left on the clock secured their fate. The Eagles have never appeared in a Super Bowl since, but this was their closest one at winning. \", 'question_id': '1e92c807c4a8f2686900839579b92e13', 'answer_choices': ['2034', '2004'], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/MultimodalQA/MultiModalQA_all_images/f0266feeefbc4614dd5ab22b3688a73b.jpg', 'question': \"The 1956 Pittsburgh Steelers eagle logo opponent played what team in 2004 Super Bowl?

Gloria Estefan (born Gloria María Milagrosa Fajardo García; September 1, 1957) is a Cuban-American singer, songwriter, actress, and businesswoman. She started off her career as the lead singer in the group called \"Miami Latin Boys\" which was eventually known as Miami Sound Machine. Me Estoy Enamorando ([I\\'m Falling in Love] error: {{lang-xx}}: text has italic markup (help)) is the sixth studio album by Mexican singer Alejandro Fernández. It was released by Sony Music Mexico on 23 September 1997. It marks a musical style change where Fernández performs pop ballads and boleros as opposed to ranchera music. His decision to record a pop album transpired after having aspirations to expand his audience. Fernández asked Emilio Estefan to produce his next project after listening to Mi Tierra (1993) by his wife Gloria Estefan. Recording took place at Estefan\\'s Crescent Moon Studios in Miami, Florida. Estefan\\'s partner Kike Santander co-produced the recording along with Estefan and composed most of the album\\'s tracks. The musical style consists of pop-boleros with ranchera influences while the lyrics reflect the theme of love. Four singles were released from the album: \"Si Tú Supieras\", \"En El Jardín\" (a duet with Gloria Estefan), \"No Sé Olvidar\", and \"Yo Nací Para Amarte\". Each of them reached number one on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart in the United States. A tour to promote the album was launched in the US and Latin America.

The idea to release an all Spanish-language album was pitched by Secada\\'s music mentor Emilio Estefan, after realizing that SBK Records have yet released such an album. Estefan presented Secada\\'s proposal for a Spanish-language recording to the head of Capitol EMI Records Charles Koppelman and then president of EMI Latin Jose Behar. Koppelman accepted the proposal after Behar stated that he could see \"market potential\" for Secada. With the help of Emilio\\'s wife, Gloria Estefan, Secada translated selected compositions from his English-language debut album for Otro Día Más Sin Verte.

He tells Julie that if he did not leave when he did, he may have never left. He still, however, wishes to be with her and has already bought her a plane ticket back to Chicago. Julie still cares for Matt and wants to go with him, but she declines, saying that upending her life to follow him to Chicago will prevent her from pursuing her own dreams.

Probation first developed in the United States when John Augustus, a Boston cobbler, persuaded a judge in the Boston Police Court in 1841 to give him custody of a convicted offender, a \"drunkard,\" for a brief period and then helped the man to appear rehabilitated by the time of sentencing. Even earlier, the practice of suspending a sentence was used as early as 1830 in Boston, Massachusetts, and became widespread in U.S. courts, although there was no statutory provision for such a practice. At first, judges, most notably Peter Oxenbridge Thatcher of Boston, used \"release on recognizance\" or bail and simply refrained from taking any further action. In 1878 the mayor of Boston had hired a former police officer, the ironically named \"Captain Savage,\" to become what many recognize as the first official probation officer. By the mid-19th century, however, many Federal Courts were using a judicial reprieve to suspend sentence, and this posed a legal question. In 1916, the United States Supreme Court, in the Killets Decision, held that a Federal Judge (Killets) was without power to suspend a sentence indefinitely. This decision led to the passing of the National Probation Act of 1925, thereby, allowing courts to suspend the imposition of incarceration and place an offender on probation. Probation developed from the efforts of a philanthropist, John Augustus, who looked for ways to rehabilitate the behavior of criminals.

Halftime shows are a tradition during American football games at all levels of competition. Entertainment during the Super Bowl, the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL), represents a fundamental link to pop culture, which helps broaden the television audience and nationwide interest. As the Super Bowl itself is typically the most-watched event on television in the United States annually, the halftime show has been equally-viewed in recent years: the halftime show of Super Bowl XLIX featuring Katy Perry was viewed by 118.5 million, as part of an overall telecast that peaked at 120.3 million at its conclusion—the most-watched television broadcast in U.S. history. The NFL claims that the Super Bowl LI halftime show, with Lady Gaga was the \"most-watched musical event of all-time\", citing a figure of 150 million viewers based on the television audience, as well as unique viewership of video postings of the halftime show on the league\\'s platforms, and social media interactions. However, the show was only seen by 117.5 million television viewers, making it the second-highest-rated halftime show behind Super Bowl XLIX.

He then sailed to Boston after his fleet was damaged in a storm. In 1779, d'Estaing again led his fleet to North America for joint operations, this time against British-held Savannah, Georgia. About 3,000 French joined with 2,000 Americans in the Siege of Savannah, in which a naval bombardment was unsuccessful.

In 2013, Mason starred as Ted Keegan in the fifth season of Go Girls and he had a supporting role in crime drama The Blue Rose. The following year, he joined the cast of Home and Away as Martin Ashford. Home and Away (often abbreviated as H&A) is an Australian television soap opera. It was created by Alan Bateman and commenced broadcast on the Seven Network on 17 January 1988. Bateman came up with the concept of the show during a trip to Kangaroo Point, New South Wales,  where he noticed locals were complaining about the construction of a foster home and against the idea of foster children from the city living in the area. The soap opera was initially going to be called Refuge, but the name was changed to the \"friendlier\" title of Home and Away once production began.  The show premiered with a ninety-minute pilot episode (subsequently in re-runs known as Home and Away: The Movie). Since then, each subsequent episode has aired for a duration of twenty-two minutes and Home and Away has become the second longest-running drama series in Australian television. In Australia, it is currently broadcast from Mondays to Thursdays at 7:00 pm.

The Theatre was constructed in Shoreditch in 1576 by James Burbage with his brother-in-law John Brayne (the owner of the unsuccessful Red Lion playhouse of 1567) and the Newington Butts playhouse was set up, probably by Jerome Savage, some time between 1575 and 1577.

Warner Bros. chose to film in Chicago for 13 weeks, because Nolan had a \"truly remarkable experience\" filming part of Batman Begins there. Instead of using the Chicago Board of Trade Building as the location for the headquarters of Wayne Enterprises, as Batman Begins did, The Dark Knight shows Wayne Enterprises as being headquartered in the Richard J. Daley Center. While filming in Chicago, the film was given the false title Rory\\'s First Kiss to lower the visibility of production, but the local media eventually uncovered the ruse. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times commented on the absurdity of the technique, \"Is there a Bat-fan in the world that doesn\\'t know Rory\\'s First Kiss is actually The Dark Knight, which has been filming in Chicago for weeks?\" Production of The Dark Knight in Chicago generated $45\\xa0million in the city\\'s economy and created thousands of jobs.

Noticeably, unlike Batman Begins, less CGI was used to disguise Chicago. Many recognizable locations were used in the film, like the Sears Tower, Navy Pier, 330 North Wabash, the James R. Thompson Center, Trump International Hotel and Tower, LaSalle Street, The Berghoff, Randolph Street Station, and Hotel 71. An old Brach\\'s factory was used as Gotham Hospital. The defunct Van Buren Street post office doubles as Gotham National Bank for the opening bank robbery. Several sequences, including one car chase, were shot on the lower level of Wacker Drive. The Marina City towers also appear in the background throughout the movie.

Former Australian Prime Minister John Howard has argued against a bill of rights for Australia on the grounds it would transfer power from elected politicians (populist politics) to unelected (constitutional) judges and bureaucrats. Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) are the only states and territories to have a human rights Act.  However, the principle of legality present in the Australian judicial system, seeks to ensure that legislation is interpreted so as not to interfere with basic human rights, unless legislation expressly intends to interfere.  \", 'question_id': 'c94de5f7b3328a5f218c85a3f73c8822', 'answer_choices': ['seven', 'six'], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/MultimodalQA/MultiModalQA_all_images/14eecd721a335cb6723095cde8ff640d.jpg', 'question': 'What length sleeves are shown on the singer whose song which is actually titled \"She Works Hard for the Money\"? \"She Works Hard for the Money\" is a song by American singer Donna Summer from her 1983 eleventh studio album of the same name.

Only two teams currently in the NFL, the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears) and the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals), are founding members. The Green Bay Packers, founded 1919 (joined the NFL in 1921), is the oldest NFL franchise in continuous operation with the same name in the same location.

The objective of the Congress was to provide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. The goal was not simply to restore old boundaries but to resize the main powers so they could balance each other and remain at peace. The leaders were conservatives with little use for republicanism or revolution, both of which threatened to upset the status quo in Europe. France lost all its recent conquests while Prussia, Austria and Russia made major territorial gains. Prussia added smaller German states in the west, Swedish Pomerania and 60% of the Kingdom of Saxony; Austria gained Venice and much of northern Italy. Russia gained parts of Poland.

Where will you currently find the coach who led this opposing team during their 1994 season? Samuel David \"Sam\" Wyche (born January 5, 1945) is a former American football player and current coach at Pickens High School in South Carolina. Wyche is a former player and former head coach for the Cincinnati Bengals. Perhaps best known for introducing the use of the No-huddle offense as a standard offense (as opposed to use at the end of the half), Wyche\\'s greatest achievement as a head coach was leading the Cincinnati Bengals to Super Bowl XXIII, which they lost to the 49ers 20–16, relinquishing the lead with only 34 seconds remaining. The 1994 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season began with the death of owner Hugh Culverhouse. Ownership was transferred to a three-man board of trustees. Season ticket sales dwindled, and rumors of the team\\'s location were a persistent distraction all year. At mid-season, the new ownership removed all personnel responsibilities from coach Sam Wyche, and gave them to Vice President Rich McKay, who they named general manager. They also put the team up for sale. On the field, Errict Rhett became the first rookie in the team\\'s history to rush for 1,000 yards, despite not starting until the ninth game of the season. The Buccaneers had one of the weakest offenses in the league, even while led by a coach who had consistently produced top offenses while with the Cincinnati Bengals. At 2–9, most people in the Bay area were ready to hang Wyche and pack his bags, but the defensive line improved as Eric Curry finally matured in the second half of the season, and the Bucs began their first 4-game winning streak in 15 years. It started with an overtime win in Minnesota. Two wins over the Washington Redskins and one over the Los Angeles Rams set up a big game in Tampa against the Green Bay Packers, who were trying to secure a playoff spot. \"We\\'ve arrived\", Wyche announced prematurely.  The final game was called \"Orange Pride day\", and was attended by 65,000 fans (although many were rooting for the visitors), most of whom expected it to be the last football game in Tampa. The Packers won, 34–19.

The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, accompanied by a wide area (later known as the \"death strip\") that contained anti-vehicle trenches, \"fakir beds\" and other defenses.

The gravity of Mars is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass around Mars are brought towards it. It is weaker than Earth's gravity owing to the planet's smaller mass. The average gravitational acceleration on Mars is 3.72076 ms−2 (about 38% of that of Earth) and it varies laterally. In general, topography-controlled isostasy drives the short wavelength free-air gravity anomalies. At the same time, convective flow and finite strength of the mantle lead to long-wavelength planetary-scale free-air gravity anomalies over the entire planet. Variation in crustal thickness, magmatic and volcanic activities, impact-induced Moho-uplift, seasonal variation of polar ice caps, atmospheric mass variation and variation of porosity of the crust could also correlate to the lateral variations. Over the years models consisting of an increasing but limited number of spherical harmonics have been produced. Maps produced have included free-air gravity anomaly, Bouguer gravity anomaly, and crustal thickness. In some areas of Mars there is a correlation between gravity anomalies and topography.  Given the known topography, higher resolution gravity field can be inferred. Tidal deformation of Mars by the Sun or Phobos can be measured by its gravity. This reveals how stiff the interior is, and shows that the core is partially liquid.The study of surface gravity of Mars can therefore yield information about different features and provide beneficial information for future landing projects. \", 'question_id': '3a8711068937fb9ac2748dcd7aa776f2', 'answer_choices': ['72 msâ\\x80\\x9aÃ\\xa0Ã\\xad2 (about 38% of that of Earth)', '3.72076 msâ\\x80\\x9aÃ\\xa0Ã\\xad2 (about 38% of that of Earth)'], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/MultimodalQA/MultiModalQA_all_images/f7c9753651455478a4a6f1ddd0d1f642.jpg', 'question': \"Which band from the location that features three statues made of stone with hammer like tops and was a part of the 1998 Tippeligain was Liv Kristine a member of?

In January 1863, McClernand and Sherman's combined XIII and XV corps, the Army of the Mississippi, defeated the Confederates at Arkansas Post. Grant made five attempts to capture Vicksburg by water routes; however, all failed. With the Union impatient for a victory, in March 1863, the second stage to capture Vicksburg began. Grant marched his troops down the west side of the Mississippi River and crossed over at Bruinsburg. Adm. David D. Porter’s navy ships had previously made a run past Vicksburg's batteries on April 16, 1863, enabling Union troops to be transported to the east side of the river. The crossing succeeded due to Grant's elaborate series of demonstrations and diversions that masked his intended movements from the Confederates. After the crossing, Grant maneuvered his army inland, and after a series of battles, the state capital, Jackson, Mississippi, was captured. Confederate general John C. Pemberton was defeated by Grant’s forces at the battles of Champion Hill and of Black River Bridge and retreated to the Vicksburg fortress. After two unsuccessful and costly assaults on Vicksburg, Grant settled in for a 40-day siege. Pemberton, unable to combine forces with the army of Joseph E. Johnson, which was hovering in central Mississippi, finally surrendered Vicksburg on July 4, 1863. The capture of Vicksburg was a turning point for the Union war effort. The surrender of Vicksburg and the defeat of Confederate general Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg were stinging defeats for the Confederacy, now split in two by the Union's domination of the Mississippi River. President Lincoln promoted Grant to the permanent rank of Major General in the Regular Army. Vicksburg marked the second surrender of a Confederate army (the other being Buckner's surrender to Grant the year before). During the Vicksburg siege, Grant dismissed McClernand for publishing to the press a congratulatory order that seemed to claim it was McClernand's corps that was winning the campaign. McClernand appealed the dismissal to his personal friend, President Lincoln, but to no avail. Grant had ended the rivalry on his own terms. The Union army had captured considerable Confederate artillery, small arms, and ammunition. Total casualties, killed or wounded, for the final operation against Vicksburg that started on March 29, 1863 were 10,142 for the Union and 9,091 for the Confederacy. \", 'question_id': '6518df50bd2af6d647db856fef1ec9bc', 'answer_choices': ['Lee', 'Grant'], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/MultimodalQA/MultiModalQA_all_images/6fc74111b5698b619019e0424c673a36.jpg', 'question': \"in Adaptations of Full House (manhwa), the landform that separates vietnam from the country that features a palace on the flag and laos is?

The flashing light may be a \"full\" green, or a green left arrow, both meaning the same thing. At least one traffic light in Montreal (on the Island of Montreal, \\'Right-on-Red\\' is not allowed), has a flashing right-turn arrow, indicating that the pedestrian crossing has a red light, so it is safe to turn right and drive across it. At some intersections in Winnipeg, Manitoba, a flashing green right-turn arrow appears with a red light when traffic from the right has a green flashing left-turn arrow and is not allowed to make a U-turn. In other parts of the same country (e.g., Vancouver) a flashing green light conveys a very different meaning: the crossing road has stop signs with no lights of its own, and oncoming traffic also has a flashing green, not a red stop-light. This functions the same as a European \"priority\" sign (a yellow-and-white diamond shaped sign indicating that the current street is a Priority or \"main\" road, which cross streets must yield to at uncontrolled junctions, opposite to the usual arrangement in many European countries), for which there is no direct equivalent in North America.

From 1999 until 2004, the team continually improved, going from 5–11 in 1999, returning to the playoffs in with an 11–5 record in 2000, surpassing the Buccaneers in the Wild Card round before losing in the divisional. Moreover, the Eagles played in four straight NFC Championship Games between 2001 and 2004. In 2001, the Eagles stayed at 11–5, beating the Buccaneers and Bears to advance to the NFC championship, where they lost to the St. Louis Rams. In 2002, the Eagles drafted running back Brian Westbrook, got the 1st round bye with the 2nd seed in the NFC with a 12–4 record, but the Tampa Bay Buccaneers got their revenge in the Championship and eliminated the Eagles. In 2003, they won the NFC first seed, but Westbrook went down in Week 17, culminating in a loss to the Carolina Panthers in their 3rd straight NFC Championship. In 2004, the Philadelphia Eagles had their best season since 1960, going 13–1 before resting their starters and losing their next 2, clinching the 1st seed for the second year in a row. McNabb set career highs, completing 64% of his passes for 3,875 yards, though he didn't play all 16 games. McNabb became the first quarterback ever to throw more than 30 touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions in a season. His success could be attributed to the fact that he had a reliable receiver, Terrell Owens, who got 1,200 yards and 14 touchdowns in 14 games. After beating the Vikings and Falcons the Eagles advanced to Super Bowl XXXIX, where they dueled the New England Patriots. Although McNabb threw 3 touchdown passes and 357 yards in the game, and the score was tied 14–14 going into the fourth quarter, the Patriots outscored the Eagles and scored ten straight points. McNabb completed a 30-yard touchdown pass, and the Eagles defense held the Patriots to a 3 and out, but a crucial interception with 46 seconds left on the clock secured their fate.

Rochelle (played by Tichina Arnold) is Julius\\' strict, humorously cheeky wife and is the mother of Chris, Tonya, and Drew. She is an assertive woman who frequently becomes apprehensive over things that often have nothing to do with the current subject matter (such as Tonya becoming pregnant or her kids selling drugs). She is noted for the saucy comebacks that she uses to put a stop to any complaints that her children might have. She uses the comebacks to ensure that they do not end up performing a crime or great misdeed of some sort; she also fears that they may wind up as street criminals. The narrator describes her as a \"Ghetto Snob\", likely because of her cautious behavior towards the way her family is perceived in public. She shares loving moments with her children, showing that her true intentions for her assertive ways are sincerely because she cares for them. She also has a passion for chocolate Turtles, which often calm her, and experiences symptoms of withdrawal whenever she must sacrifice them for whatever reason. She is also noted for having to get jobs, and then quitting her job whenever she has a problem with it. Rochelle\\'s famous catchphrase that refers to this running gag is: \"I don\\'t need this, my man has two jobs!\" This expresses her using Julius\\' having two jobs as an excuse to quit her job and be comfortable at home. She is very judgemental towards Julius when it comes to their marriage. This can be seen in the episodes where she starts to think that Julius will leave her for a white woman or finds something which leads her to believe that Julius is having an affair. She sometimes disagrees to Julius\\' methods about being cheap, like when they celebrated Kwanza instead of Christmas. Julius believes that this method is an effective way to save money for more important things rather than materialistic items. There are times where Rochelle understands Julius\\' behavior, like in the episode where he got a second job in order to earn more money for the family. However, Rochelle eventually developed second thoughts about the situation, for she believed that Julius was actually throwing money away. In the final season of the series, Rochelle works as a beautician at Nessa\\'s Beauty Salon, where in previous seasons she would often get her hair done. She also shared gossip with her friend and owner of the salon, Vanessa (Jackee Harry) and other workers of the salon. Another running gag about her is that she regularly threatens her children with physical violence but does not hit them. It is only when she takes them into a room saying \"we need to talk\" when she smacks them.

There, she is enrolled at Forks High School, where she becomes intrigued by a student, Edward Cullen. When Edward saves her life, he exhibits super-human qualities. Bella learns from her family friend Jacob Black that Quileute legends say the Cullen family are actually vampires. Edward eventually admits to this truth, though his family hunts only animals, not humans, through moral choice. Edward constantly warns Bella against being with him, perceiving her life to be at constant risk if she continues to associate with him, because the scent of her blood is more powerful to him than that of any other human he has ever met. Bella's love and confidence in Edward's restraint is such that his warnings go unheeded, and on an outing with the rest of the Cullen family, she becomes the target of a sadistic vampire, James.

Boston improved upon it and exchanged records with Igor Ter-Ovanesyan seven times over the next seven years.  At the 1968 Summer Olympics Bob Beamon jumped 8.90\\xa0m (29\\xa0ft 2\\xa01⁄4\\xa0in)  at an altitude of 7,349 feet (2,240\\xa0m), a jump not exceeded for 23 years, and which remains the second longest legal jump of all time. On 30 August 1991 Mike Powell of the United States set the current men's world record at the World Championships in Tokyo.  It was in a well-known show down against Carl Lewis, who also beat Beamon's record that day but with an aiding wind (thus not legal for record purposes).  Powell's record 8.95\\xa0m (29\\xa0ft 4\\xa01⁄4\\xa0in) has now stood for more than 27 years. \", 'question_id': '472085478da603452b2c45a57fb0b45b', 'answer_choices': ['Tom Powell', 'Mike Powell'], 'answer_id': 1}, {'image_id': '/content/drive/MyDrive/2ReadyForFineTuning/MultimodalQA/MultiModalQA_all_images/65522a2fb545c317f7bf66a8067b95eb.jpg', 'question': 'The African-American player with BREAK POINTS SAVED in the 2013 WTA Tour does what for a living?
