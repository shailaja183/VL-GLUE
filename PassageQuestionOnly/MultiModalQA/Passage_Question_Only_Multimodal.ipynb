The team must risk the entire amount on each correctly of eight multiple-choice questions. The Singapore Olympic Foundation – Peter Lim Charity Cup, also known as the Peter Lim Charity Cup in short, was a exhibition fundraising match between the Singapore Selection and 2013 Copa del Rey winners, Atlético Madrid. The show sponsors are: Pokka, Wrigley's Eclipse Mints, Hershey's, Burger King and ASA Holidays. Following the basic premise of other international versions of the format, it features a group of contestants who are marooned in an isolated location, where they must provide food, water, fire, and shelter for themselves. The contestants compete in challenges for rewards and immunity from elimination. The contestants are progressively eliminated from the game as they are voted out by their fellow contestants, until only one remains and is declared the winner and awarded the grand prize of €100,000. Team Malaysia was one of the best professional \"Dota 2\" teams in Southeast Asia, establishing dominance in the region from their formation, and in May 2015, ranked as the world's 8th best and Southeast-Asia's best team, with an all time win rate of 82%.

They also visit an Igorot village, where Polgas purchases a shrunken head as a souvenir. 16 teams are involved, of which 15 came through qualifying competitions. Three teams each from Europe, China, and North America and two teams each from CIS, Southeast Asia, and South America. Tigers won DreamLeague Season 10, earned an invite as a Minor champion. Following a contest, Miyabi (Maria Ozawa as herself) is asked to deliver a prize, consisting of a pair of airplane tickets, to Jakarta, Indonesia. Excited by the prospect, she begins learning about Indonesia. However, when she attempts to board her flight she discovers that she has forgotten her passport at home and is thus stuck in Tokyo. The 2017/18 season was a disaster for West Bromwich Albion and resulted in the club's relegation from the Premier League, the previous season had been a relative success, resulting in a 10th-place finish. This sudden decline in results led owner Guochuan Lai to sack Chairman John Williams, CEO Martin Goodman, and later technical director Nick Hammond for their part in the failures of the 2017/18 season.

The event has had remarkably few winners over its history with local driver Hayden Paddon having won five editions, whereas Indian Gaurav Gill has won three times and Australian Chris Atkinson has won twice. As of 2019, the choice of haka to be performed is typically discussed between the designated haka leader and other team leaders, usually the captain, in the run-up to the match. The one exception is for matches held in Wellington. While \"Kapa o Pango\" has been performed there in the past, the team's current practice is to always perform \"Ka Mate\" in Wellington as a show of respect to its composer Te Rauparaha, who lived in that region. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \"place of many clouds\" for \"Ōaonui\". Twelve main urban areas (half of them officially cities) are in the North Island. From north to south, they are Whangarei, Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga, Rotorua, Gisborne, New Plymouth, Napier, Hastings, Whanganui, Palmerston North, and Wellington, the capital, located at the south-west extremity of the island. About 77% of New Zealand's population lives in the North Island. Born in Samoa, Pisi's parents moved him and his brother George to Auckland as youngsters. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \"place of shaking\" (ie an earthquake) for \"Ōngarue\". The two countries are antipodes, and their capitals, Madrid and Wellington are on almost the exact opposite side of the world from each other. Prior to the team's foundation in 2018, Baseball New Zealand, the country's governing body of the sport of baseball, held talks starting in 2009 regarding the prospects of adding a New Zealand-based team in the Australian Baseball League. In November 2017, the league decided to expand to eight teams beginning in the 2018/19 season, and Baseball New Zealand was officially awarded a spot in the competition.

Johnson, as incumbent mayor, had chosen not to stand for re-election for a third term in office, having been elected as the Conservative Party MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the 2015 general election. The campaign was dominated by the personal battle between Goldsmith and Khan, and their contrasting class and ethnic backgrounds. Through his victory, Khan became the second Labour Party Mayor of London after Livingstone, and the first Muslim mayor of a European Union capital city. Unveiled on November 8, 2017 by the then Governor of Lagos State, Akinwunmi Ambode, the sculptor Hamza Attah cited cultural significance of Epe as a home of fishing activities and that the Monument portrayed contemporary Epe as the export point for fish in Lagos, noting that fishing is the main occupation of indigenes.  The Emotan Statue is a life-size statue designed in honour of Emotan, a trade chieftain who used to trade at the Oba's market in the Ancient Benin Kingdom during the reigns of Oba Uwaifiokun and Oba Ewuare the Great. The statue was unveiled on 20 March 1954 by Oba Akenzua II and is placed opposite the Oba's market in Benin City. Abdinuur Qaaji, commonly called Biindhe, was the president of Khatumo State in 2012. The Opemso Festival is a bi-annual festival held in Ghana to commemorate the iconic birth of Otumfuo Osei Tutu I, the first king of the Ashantis. The title \"Opemso\", first given to Otumfuo Osei Tutu I, is given to Ashanti kings to indicate a fearless and persistent nature in executing plans without giving in to any obstacles. In 2013, Prince Edwin Ochai created the Agila Social & Economic Carnival, with the aim of showcasing to the world the rich social, cultural and Economic endowment of the Idoma Nation through art, craft and social exhibitions. The concept of the city was conceived as a legacy project to mark the 100 year anniversary of Nigeria by January 1, 2014, during the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan.

The José Martí Memorial  is a memorial to José Martí, a national hero of Cuba, located on the northern side of the Plaza de la Revolución in the Vedado area of Havana. It consists of a star-shaped tower, a statue of Martí surrounded by six columns, and gardens. It is the largest monument to a writer in the world. Eva Maria Lewis is a student activist, advocate, poet, and artist. From South Side, Chicago, she is a contributor to \"Teen Vogue\", founder of The I Project, Youth for Black Lives, and an organizer of the July 11, 2016 youth march on Millennium Park to protest police brutality. Born Roland Snellings, on October 13, 1938, in Raleigh, North Carolina, to Clifford R. and Nancy (Bullock) Snelling, he lived under the care of his paternal grandmother in La Grange, Georgia until he was six years old. Although he later joined his family in Dayton, Ohio, his frequent trips to Georgia and North Carolina would be credited with the foundation for his early poetic imagery. The initial print run was recalled when Jake Cinninger discovered sound issues with the disc, and a second print run was unveiled in late 2005. On April 13, 2011 she organized and hosted the first Triad \"Bookup\" at Bin 33 restaurant in Greensboro, NC, to \"promote long-form reading in a short-form world.\" The public was invited to show up with any book of their choosing and read it to themselves. Maya Angelou issued a statement supporting the concept. Vermonica was a public art installation initiated by artist Sheila Klein in May 1993 and uninstalled in November 2017. The sculpture is named for the intersection of Santa Monica Boulevard and Vermont Avenue in East Hollywood. Some of the artwork's 25 lamp poles date to 1925, the year Los Angeles's Bureau of Street Lighting opened. Placed in front of a Rite-Aid, the lights glow to illuminate the mini-mall parking lot it is located in at specific times during the night. Sheila Klein cooperated with Los Angeles businesses, bureaus, departments and neighborhoods to erect what she describes as a \"formal composition\" and a \"drive-in museum\" of street lighting. \"Vermonica\" was envisioned initially as a temporary installation with borrowed poles from the nearby streetlight yard on Santa Monica Boulevard. The sculpture was so popular, however, that it was kept installed. \"Vermonica\" precedes Chris Burden's \"Urban Light\" by 15 years. Queens is the easternmost and largest in area of the five boroughs of New York City. It is geographically adjacent to the borough of Brooklyn at the southwestern end of Long Island, and to Nassau County farther east on Long Island; in addition, Queens shares water borders with the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx. Coterminous with Queens County since 1899, the borough of Queens is the second-largest in population (after Brooklyn), with a census-estimated 2,358,582 residents in 2017, approximately 48% of them foreign-born. Queens County also is the second-most populous county in the U.S. state of New York, behind the neighboring borough of Brooklyn, which is coterminous with Kings County. Queens is the fourth-most densely populated county among New York City's boroughs, as well as in the United States. If each of New York City's boroughs were an independent city, Queens also would be the nation's fourth most populous, after Los Angeles in California, Chicago in Illinois, and Brooklyn. Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. It is named after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose 2003 attempt to suppress photographs of her residence in Malibu, California, inadvertently drew further public attention to it. Similar attempts have been made, for example, in cease-and-desist letters to suppress files, websites, and even numbers. Instead of being suppressed, the information receives extensive publicity and media extensions such as videos and spoof songs, often being widely mirrored on the Internet or distributed on file-sharing networks. \"Suffragette City\" is a song by English musician David Bowie. It featured on \"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\" album in 1972, and was previously released as the B-side to the Starman single in April 1972. It was later issued as a single in 1976 to promote the \"Changesonebowie\" compilation in the UK, with the US single edit of \"Stay\" on the B-side. The single failed to chart. \n",

            "passage:  After a disappointing seventh-place finish the previous season, which left Liverpool without even UEFA Cup qualification, manager Gérard Houllier began to rebuild his squad and made seven close season signings. The attack was bolstered with the arrival of Titi Camara, Erik Meijer and Vladimír Šmicer. Succeeding Aston Villa-bound David James in goal was Dutchman Sander Westerveld. A new look central defence featured Stéphane Henchoz and Sami Hyypiä. Following the summer departure of former captain Paul Ince, Jamie Redknapp was made the new captain of the side, with Robbie Fowler appointed as vice-captain. Manchester United also completed the Treble, becoming the fourth side in Europe to do so and in the process prevented Bayern Munich from achieving the feat themselves, Bayern eventually finished runners-up in their domestic cup two weeks later. Martin Aldridge was the club's top scorer, with ten goals (seven in the league, one in the FA Cup and two in the League Cup). The 1998 FIFA World Player of the Year award was won by Zinedine Zidane, after scoring twice in France's 3–0 win over Brazil in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final. Arsenal began the new campaign as league and cup double winners, and manager Arsène Wenger sought improvement in the Champions League, a competition the club failed in. The retirement of defender Tony Adams meant French midfielder Patrick Vieira was appointed as captain; Pascal Cygan was signed as a replacement in defence. Other recruitments included defensive midfielders Gilberto Silva and Kolo Touré, while goalkeepers Alex Manninger and Richard Wright departed to join Espanyol and Everton respectively. The tournament ended with a final between Arsenal and Barcelona at Stade de France, Paris, on 17 May 2006. Barcelona won 2–1 with Juliano Belletti scoring a late winner. Arsenal had taken the lead through a Sol Campbell header in the 37th minute, despite Jens Lehmann being sent off in the 18th minute. Samuel Eto'o brought Barcelona back on level terms in the 76th minute before Belletti scored the winner five minutes later. A run of only 5 wins from their first 18 games killed off Blackburn's hopes of improving on the previous season's 6th place to qualify for the Champions League, but the club's form was markedly improved in the second half of the season, NLP expert Jimmy Petruzzi had delivered an NLP training workshop to the coaches during Blackburn Rovers loss of form and coincided with the club turning their season around achieving a top-half finish for the second season running. Rovers overcame the sale of Craig Bellamy to Liverpool, with his replacement, former Porto striker Benni McCarthy, scoring 18 league goals to finish as the Premier League's second-highest scorer behind Didier Drogba. In international football, Beckham made his England debut on 1 September 1996 at the age of 21. He was captain for six years, earning 58 caps during his tenure. He made 115 career appearances in total, appearing at three FIFA World Cup tournaments, in 1998, 2002 and 2006, and two UEFA European Championship tournaments, in 2000 and 2004. In his native country he played for Sparta Prague and Slavia Prague. He also had a successful spell at Queens Park Rangers from 1990 to 1994. He was one of only 13 foreign players to play on the opening weekend of the FA Premier League along with Peter Schmeichel, Andrei Kanchelskis, Robert Warzycha, Roland Nilsson, Eric Cantona, Hans Segers, John Faxe Jensen, Anders Limpar, Gunnar Halle, Craig Forrest, Michel Vonk and Ronnie Rosenthal. Mark Bosnich, previously at United as a reserve goalkeeper from 1989 to 1991, returned to the club as Peter Schmeichel's successor, but failed to live up to expectations and in September, the club swooped for Italian Massimo Taibi to provide competition for him. However, Taibi suffered some high-profile mistakes and returned to his homeland at the end of the season after just five games for the club. As the season wore on, long-time reserve goalkeeper Raimond van der Gouw was increasingly called on as the starting goalkeeper, and proved a fairly reliable performer, but at 37 years old as of the end of the season, it was clear that he would not be a long-term solution. United then solved the goalkeeping crisis by paying AS Monaco £7.8 million for Fabien Barthez. Also new to the squad for 1999–2000 were French defender Mikaël Silvestre and South African winger Quinton Fortune. Jesper Blomqvist and Wes Brown missed the entire season due to injury, while similar misfortune restricted defenders David May and Ronny Johnsen to three first-team appearances between them. Jordi Cruyff left the club on a free transfer to Deportivo Alavés at the end of the season, seeing out his four-year contract at a club where he had failed to claim a regular first-team place. \n",

Since the start of the newly re-branded league many players have scored a hat-trick. Hector Sam then playing for Wrexham has the distinction of being the first player to accomplish this on 10 August 2004. The first hat-trick, a player scoring three goals in a game, in Major League Soccer, was scored by Steve Rammel of D.C. United in their 5–2 win at the Columbus Crew on May 15, 1996. Stanley Victor Collymore (born 22 January 1971) is an English former footballer who played as a centre-forward from 1990 to 2001. He held the English transfer record when he moved from Nottingham Forest to Liverpool for £8.5 million in 1995 and was capped three times at senior level by the England national football team. He is currently a football pundit. Manchester United overcame close competition from Arsenal and Chelsea to win their fifth Premiership title in seven seasons. They went on to win the treble of the Premiership title, FA Cup and European Cup, an achievement which gained manager Alex Ferguson a knighthood. Martin Aldridge was the club's top scorer, with ten goals (seven in the league, one in the FA Cup and two in the League Cup). In international football, Beckham made his England debut on 1 September 1996 at the age of 21. He was captain for six years, earning 58 caps during his tenure. He made 115 career appearances in total, appearing at three FIFA World Cup tournaments, in 1998, 2002 and 2006, and two UEFA European Championship tournaments, in 2000 and 2004. Dwight Eversley Yorke CM (born 3 November 1971) is a Trinidad and Tobago former footballer. Throughout his club career, he played for Aston Villa, Manchester United, Blackburn Rovers, Birmingham City, Sydney and Sunderland, mainly as a forward, between 1988 and 2009. He was the assistant manager of the Trinidad and Tobago national team until the completion of the qualifying matches for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Yorke scored 123 goals in the Premier League, a record for a non-European which was not broken until Sergio Agüero in 2017. His greatest success at club level was as a Manchester United striker winning the unique treble of the Premier League championship, the FA Cup and UEFA Champions League in 1999. A run of only 5 wins from their first 18 games killed off Blackburn's hopes of improving on the previous season's 6th place to qualify for the Champions League, but the club's form was markedly improved in the second half of the season, NLP expert Jimmy Petruzzi had delivered an NLP training workshop to the coaches during Blackburn Rovers loss of form and coincided with the club turning their season around achieving a top-half finish for the second season running. Rovers overcame the sale of Craig Bellamy to Liverpool, with his replacement, former Porto striker Benni McCarthy, scoring 18 league goals to finish as the Premier League's second-highest scorer behind Didier Drogba. The Scottish Premier League (SPL) was a football league competition that operated between 1998 and 2013. During that period, more than 100 players scored three goals (a hat-trick) or more in a single match. The first player to achieve the feat was Craig Burley, who scored three times for Celtic in a 5–0 victory against Dunfermline Athletic on the opening day of the first SPL season. Eight players scored more than three goals in a match; of these, three players, Kris Boyd (twice), Gary Hooper and Kenny Miller scored five. James Peter Greaves (born 20 February 1940) is a former England international footballer who played as a forward. He is England's fourth highest international goalscorer (44 goals), Tottenham Hotspur's highest ever goalscorer (266 goals), the highest goalscorer in the history of English top-flight football (357 goals), and has also scored more hat-tricks (six) for England than anyone else. He finished as the First Division's top scorer in six seasons. He is a member of the English Football Hall of Fame. \n",

            "passage:  The show pitted two teams of celebrities (one all-male, one all-female) against one another; each led by a professional Formula One racing driver in a battle of the sexes. Following its first appearance at the Stockholm Allt för Sjön fair, the Eelex 8000 was then displayed on the “Power of Silence tour.” The purpose of the tour was to showcase the specifications of the electric boat across Italy, Spain, France and Sweden. The tour was scheduled for the duration of 5 months, and was organised around three different themes: music, art & the marine industry. Despite the above mentioned awards and unanimous critical approval, The Wire never won a single Primetime Emmy Award nor received any major nominations, except for two writing nominations in 2005 and 2008. Several critics recognized its lack of recognition by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. According to a report by Variety, anonymous Emmy voters cited reasons such as the series' dense and multilayered plot, the grim subject matter, and the series' lack of connection with California, as it is set and filmed in Baltimore. The circuit was established in 1967 by Dr. Yoshikazu Fujita, a local physician. In 1970 the track was paved and redesigned into a road racing course. Between 1978 and 1987 the track was closed. The 1947 St Helier Circuit was a 5.149 km (3.199 m) Grand Prix road course in the town of Saint Helier, the capital of Jersey which is the largest of the North Sea Channel Islands (English Channel), hosting four consecutive Grand Prix events (official name: J.C.C. Jersey Road Race) from 1947 to 1950, the last one a Formula One non-championship round. The circuit length remained largely the same over its four editions except for small variances within 100 meters. British entries with Peter Whitehead, Reg Parnell, Raymond Mays, Peter Walker, Cuth Harrison, Leslie Johnson and David Hampshire among many others dominated the series, winning all events over many top drivers of the era. The Señor de los Temblores (Lord of the Earthquakes), known in Quechua as Taytacha Temblores, is a statue of the crucifixion of Jesus from Cusco Cathedral in Cusco, Peru. The image is popularly believed to have placated any further disaster caused by the 1650 earthquake. It became the patron saint of Cusco, and is one of the most well-known images in Peru. It was created in Seville around 1570 and it is sent to the Viceroyalty of Peru, secured in an ark and secured on the deck of a ship destined to cross the sea and reach the port of Callao, from where it would be transferred to the city of Cusco, and is made of mixed materials, including sticks, plaques of agave fiber, and plaster. The black color is not the original tone but was created from centuries of smoke, dust, buildup of soot from candles and oil lamps, and pigment and pollen from the red \"ñuk'chu\" flowers that are showered on the statue when it is taken in procession on Holy Monday, and was not cleaned during restoration of the cathedral interior in the 1990s. Four pathetic narrow minded petty criminals are mistaken for hitmen while ordered to shadow the philandering girl friend of their crime boss Carlito. As a result of a misunderstanding they get hired to accompany Léonore de Segonzac, the heiress of a big asset, on a race through Patagonia and \"accidentally\" kill her for the sum of four million dollars. They are chased by the principal and the true killers, which for their part are hunted by some UNO blue helmets. Race to the Altar is an American reality television series hosted by Lisa Dergan. The series premiered July 30, 2003, on NBC. The show found 8 engaged couples to compete in a series of physical and mental challenges designed to test the strength of their relationship. Couples who won the challenges become power couples and have the authority to eliminate other couples. The audience voted on the winning couple in the second-to-last episode and then in the last episode the winning couple gets the prize, a fantasy wedding planned by Colin Cowie. A two-hour series finale aired September 13, 2003. The Valeriepieris circle is a circular region on the world map centred in the South China Sea that is about 4,000 km in radius and contains more than half the world’s population. It was named after the Reddit username of Ken Myers, a Texas ESL teacher, who first drew attention to the phenomenon in 2013. The map became a meme and was featured in numerous forms of media.

            "passage:  Founded in 1565 by the Portuguese, the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a domain of the Portuguese Empire. Later, in 1763, it became the capital of the State of Brazil, a state of the Portuguese Empire. In 1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from Portugal to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal, who subsequently, in 1815, under the leadership of her son, the Prince Regent, and future King João VI of Portugal, raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves. Rio stayed the capital of the pluricontinental Lusitanian monarchy until 1822, when the War of Brazilian Independence began. This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonising country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies. Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy, the Empire of Brazil, until 1889, and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to Brasília. Balneario de Rincón is a public beach in Rincon, Puerto Rico. It hosted the Triathlon events for the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games. O Caminho da Fé, or The Walk of Faith, is a 497 kilometer pilgrimage trail to the Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida, in São Paulo, Brazil. Buga , formally Guadalajara de Buga, is a city and municipality in the Valle del Cauca Department of Colombia. It is famous for its Basilica del Señor de los Milagros, which houses an image of Christ called \"el Señor de los Milagros\" (\"the Lord of the Miracles\"). The Terreiro de Jesus is a plaza of great historic and cultural importance located in the Historic Center of Salvador de Bahia in Brazil. The square is located in the oldest part of the city and abuts the Praça da Sé.  Officially the plaza is known as the Praça 15 de Novembro. Though the route changes to accommodate various ports of call, the race typically departs Europe in October, and in recent editions has had either 9 or 10 legs, with in-port races at many of the stopover cities. The most recent race, the 2017–18 Volvo Ocean Race started in Alicante, Spain, and concluded in The Hague, Netherlands, with stopovers in Lisbon, Cape Town, Melbourne, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Auckland, Itajaí, Newport, Cardiff and Gothenburg.  The site of the Barra Olympic Park was formerly occupied by the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet, also known as Jacarepaguá. It was a former Formula One circuit that hosted the Brazilian Grand Prix on a number of occasions throughout the 1980s, before the Grand Prix went back to its original home at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, Interlagos, in 1990. Jacarepaguá was partly demolished to make way for the City of Sports Complex, a cluster of three venues constructed for the 2007 Pan American Games, held in Rio de Janeiro. The venues consisted the Maria Lenk Aquatic Center, which held diving, swimming and synchronized swimming events, the Rio Olympic Arena, which held basketball and artistic gymnastics events, and the Barra Velodrome, which held track cycling and speed roller skating events. Construction of the City of Sports was not without setbacks – the original plan for the complex called for a large-scale entertainment complex, valued at R$ 500 million and contracted to private firms for construction. These plans, however, fell through, and a smaller-scale plan for the complex was adopted instead. Opposition efforts by preservationists of the Jacarepaguá, the unsuitable soil at the construction site and numerous strike actions by workers delayed the venue's construction, which initially planned to begin in 2005, but was delayed until mid-2006. Despite these challenges, the venues were completed in time for the games in July 2007, and cost a relatively cheaper R$ 205 million to construct, with venues smaller than originally planned. Cristo del Pacífico, \"the Christ of the Pacific\", is a statue of Jesus erected in Lima, Peru, in 2011. Its erection was a gift from a consortium of Brazilian companies to the city of Lima, under former President Alan García, and described as a parting gift to the nation on occasion of his leaving office after the 2011 presidential election. It was inspired by the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro. The statue, and the globe on which it rests, are situated at the end of the Fatucama peninsula, facing out to the ocean and can be reached by climbing some 597 steps. The Señor de los Temblores (Lord of the Earthquakes), known in Quechua as Taytacha Temblores, is a statue of the crucifixion of Jesus from Cusco Cathedral in Cusco, Peru.

            "passage:  The 2017 FA Cup Final was the 136th final of the FA Cup, the world's oldest football cup competition. It took place on 27 May 2017 at Wembley Stadium in London, England and was contested between London rivals Arsenal and Chelsea. Arsenal won the game 2–1 to secure a record 13th title, while manager Arsène Wenger became the most successful manager in the tournament's history with seven wins. Having already won the league title (which meant Manchester United qualified for the 1977–78 European Cup Winners' Cup regardless of win or loss) and then going on to win the European Cup four days later, United's victory prevented Liverpool from becoming the first club to win the Treble (First Division, FA Cup and European Cup) – Manchester United achieved this feat 22 years later. The 1981 FA Cup Final was the 100th final of the FA Cup, and was contested by Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City. Manchester United secured a record 11th FA Cup victory with a headed goal from Cristiano Ronaldo and a brace from Ruud van Nistelrooy, which included a penalty kick. In contrast, it was Millwall's first appearance in a final of either the FA Cup or the Football League Cup. At the trophy presentation after the match, the Manchester United players wore shirts bearing the name and number of midfielder Jimmy Davis, who died in a road accident in August 2003. The 2004 FA Cup Final was the 123rd FA Cup Final and the fourth to be played at the Millennium Stadium, the Welsh national stadium in Cardiff, due to the ongoing reconstruction of the usual venue, London's Wembley Stadium. The match took place on 22 May 2004 and it was contested by Manchester United, who had finished third in the Premier League that season, and Millwall, who had finished 10th in the First Division. As both teams were in the highest tier of English football, the Premier League, they entered the competition in the Third Round. Matches up to the semi-final were contested on a one-off basis, with a replay taking place if the match ended in a draw. Chelsea's matches ranged from comfortable victories to close affairs. They beat Tottenham Hotspur 5–1 in the semi-final, while they beat Queens Park Rangers 1–0 in the Fourth Round. Liverpool's matches were similar, with three ending in a 2–1 scoreline, while the other two against Oldham Athletic and Brighton & Hove Albion were won by at least four goals. Ipswich Town qualified for the UEFA Cup as a result of finishing third the previous season behind Liverpool and Manchester United. AZ '67 finished the 1979–80 Eredivisie season in second place, three points behind champions AFC Ajax. Both teams entered the competition in the second round. Liverpool's matches were generally comfortable victories, with the exception of the semi-final against Manchester City, which they won 2–1 over two-legs. West Ham's matches were generally close affairs, they only won by more two goals once, when they beat Burnley 6–0 over two-legs in the second round. As defending First Division champions for the first time in 71 years, they qualified for the European Cup for the first time in their history. Their first game in the competition was against Valur of Iceland, following by a second round clash with Dynamo Berlin of East Germany, Dynamo Kiev of the Soviet Union in the quarter-finals and then Anderlecht of Belgium in the semi-finals before beating Bayern Munich of West Germany 1–0 in the Final in Rotterdam, with Peter Withe scoring the winning goal. The 2019 FA Cup Final was the 138th FA Cup Final, the final match of the 2018–19 FA Cup. It was played at Wembley Stadium in London, England, on 18 May 2019, contested by Manchester City and Watford. Manchester City won the match 6–0, with two goals each from Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling, and one each from David Silva and man of the match Kevin De Bruyne, in only the third time a team has scored six goals in an FA Cup Final. The margin of victory is the joint largest in an FA Cup Final, equalling Bury's 6–0 win over Derby County in 1903. The win completed City a domestic treble, unprecedented for any English teams. Since Manchester City have already qualified for the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, Wolverhampton Wanderers will enter the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League in the second qualifying round. \n",

            "passage:  The event was established in 1834, and it was originally held at Tempelhof on the site of what became Berlin Tempelhof Airport. It was initially contested over 2,400 metres, and it was extended to 2,800 metres in 1837. Because pole stiffness and length are important factors to a vaulter's performance, it is not uncommon for an elite vaulter to carry as many as ten poles to a competition. The effective properties of a pole can be changed by gripping the pole higher or lower in relation to the top of the pole. The left and right handgrips are typically a bit more than shoulder width apart. Poles are manufactured for people of all skill levels and body sizes, with sizes as short as 3.05 m (10 ft 0 in) to as long as 5.30 m (17 ft 5 in), with a wide range of weight ratings. Each manufacturer determines the weight rating for the pole and the location of the maximum handhold band. The show consists of three rounds, regarding the guest's past, present and future, and in each round, a team member holds a satirical monologue. A point is awarded based on the response of the studio audience using a clap-o-meter. However, the measurements of the clap-o-meter are never shown to the viewers. It is not uncommon for the speaker to make fun of team members or members of the other team, in particular to Horace Cohen. Nacktfussball consists of matches between two teams of four women each. Players start out in normal football outfits, but every time a goal is scored, the opposing team has to remove a piece of clothing. Once both teams are fully naked, the match continues for seven minutes and then ends. Scheibenschlagen (disk flinging) is a traditional event in Central Europe in which glowing wooden disks (10 x 10 cm / 4 x 4 inches) are flung from a long hazelnut stick off a mountain side into the valley below. The Aperschnalzen involves the rhythmic snapping and cracking of a whip up to 4 m in length (called \"Goassl\" in Austro-Bavarian) and takes place at the end of January and early February. It is performed in small groups (\"Passen\" in Bavarian) of 7, 9 or 11 members each. It has been thought that this tradition had a pagan meaning of \"driving the winter away\" by whipcracking. Fersommlinge are typically attended by the Fancy Dutch, as opposed to the \"Plain sects\" of the Amish, Brethren and Mennonites. The term literally means \"a congregation,\" not in the sense of a group of church-goers, but as a \"social gathering of people.\" Fersommlinge are not religious functions, though many churches and church groups hosted the events and used them to raise money. The Pennsylvania German dialect is the only language spoken at the event, and those who speak English pay a penalty, usually in the form of a nickel, dime or quarter, per word spoken, put into a bowl in the center of the table. Perchtenlaufen is a folk custom found in the Tyrol region of central Europe. Occurring on set occasions, the ceremony involves two groups of locals fighting against one another using wooden canes and sticks. Both groups are masked, one as 'beautiful' and the other as 'ugly' Perchte. The Spitzen Leichtathletik Luzern (English: Top Athletics Lucerne) is an annual track and field meet that takes place in Lucerne, Switzerland. First held in 1987, the meeting usually takes place in July at Stadion Allmend. The Mettenschicht is an old German mining custom in the Ore Mountains.

            "passage:  The event was established in 1834, and it was originally held at Tempelhof on the site of what became Berlin Tempelhof Airport. It was initially contested over 2,400 metres, and it was extended to 2,800 metres in 1837. The pole vault at the Summer Olympics is grouped among the four track and field jumping events held at the multi-sport event. The men's pole vault has been present on the Olympic athletics programme since the first Summer Olympics in 1896. The women's event is one of the latest additions to the programme, first being contested at the 2000 Summer Olympics – along with the addition of the hammer throw, this brought the women's field event programme to parity with the men's. The first men's events came at the 1904 Summer Olympics: a triathlon had long jump, shot put, and 100-yard dash events, while an all-around championship saw athletes compete over ten events, forming the basis for the decathlon. No combined events were held at the subsequent games, but the 1912 Summer Olympics saw the introduction of the modern decathlon event and also a men's pentathlon (which lasted for three games). The first women's event came in 1964 in the form of the women's pentathlon. This was amended to include two more events, becoming the heptathlon at the 1984 Summer Olympics, reflecting the development of women's sport. Whoever earned the most points from both competitions won the event. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, the ski jumping was held first, followed by 18 km cross-country skiing. The cross-country skiing portion was reduced to 15 km at the 1956 Winter Olympics. The ski jumping styles would change over the years as well, from the Kongsberger technique after World War I to the Daescher technique in the 1950s to the current V-style from 1985 onwards. The salchow jump is an edge jump in figure skating. It was named after its inventor, Ulrich Salchow, in 1909. The salchow is accomplished with a takeoff from the back inside edge of one foot and a landing on the back outside edge of the opposite foot. It is \"usually the first jump that skaters learn to double, and the first or second to triple\". Timing is critical because both the takeoff and landing must be on the backward edge. A salchow is deemed cheated if the skate blade starts to turn forward before the takeoff, or if it has not turned completely backward when the skater lands back on the ice. The event was established in 1888, and it was originally staged at Hoppegarten as the Grosser Preis von Berlin. It was initially contested over 2,000 metres, and was extended to 2,200 metres in 1897. It was transferred to Grunewald and increased to 2,400 metres in 1909. A new distance of 2,600 metres was introduced in 1927. Steinstossen is the Swiss variant of stone put, a competition in throwing a heavy stone. Practiced among the alpine population since prehistoric times, it is recorded to have taken place in Basel in the 13th century. During the 15th century, it is frequently recorded to have been practiced alongside the \"Schützenfeste\" of the Old Swiss Confederacy. It is also central to the Unspunnenfest, first held in 1805, with its symbol the 83.5 kg Unspunnenstein. Starting his international sporting career only in his late thirties at the 1968 Winter Olympics of Grenoble, Krienbühl mostly skated at the back of the field. However, in 1974, he introduced the one-piece skin suit into speed skating. In spite of the fact that he improved his times dramatically, he was initially laughed at. However, when other skaters also showed improvement, the top skaters quickly switched to the suits as well. Krienbühl also introduced minor improvements for skates. The Kongsberger technique (Norwegian: \"Kongsbergknekk\") was created by Jacob Tullin Thams and Sigmund Ruud in Kongsberg, Norway. Developed after World War I, the technique was characterised by the athlete's upper body being bent at the hip, with arms extended at the front in the manner of a \"superhero\", and skis held parallel to each other. Sometimes the arms would be waved or 'flapped' around vigorously in a bird-like manner. This technique extended jumping lengths from to over , and was used in ski jumping until being superseded by the Windisch and Däscher techniques in the 1950s.

            "passage:  Super Bowl XLIII, the league's championship game, was at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, on February 1, 2009, with the Pittsburgh Steelers coming out victorious over the Arizona Cardinals 27–23 and winning their NFL-record sixth Vince Lombardi Trophy. Marty Schottenheimer of the Cleveland Browns led the AFC team against an NFC team coached by Washington Redskins head coach Joe Gibbs. The referee was Dick Jorgensen. Matthew Garrett Forte (born December 10, 1985) is an American football running back for the New York Jets in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Tulane and was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the second round of the 2008 NFL Draft. Forte established himself as a dual-threat running back who is capable of earning yards as a rusher and receiver. Forte spent eight years with the Bears before signing with the Jets in 2016. The 1988 Pro Bowl was the NFL's 38th annual all-star game which featured the outstanding performers from the 1987 season. The game was played on Sunday, February 7, 1988, at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii before a crowd of 50,113. The final score was AFC 15, NFC 6. This game featured two teams ending long Super Bowl appearance droughts. The Colts, who finished with a 12–4 regular season record, were making their first Super Bowl appearance since winning Super Bowl V in the 1970 season during the team's tenure in Baltimore, they had moved to Indianapolis in 1984. Meanwhile, the Bears, who posted an NFC-best 13–3 regular season record, were making their first appearance since winning Super Bowl XX in the 1985 season. In addition, the Bears' Lovie Smith and the Colts' Tony Dungy both became the first African-American head coaches to coach in the Super Bowl, with Dungy the first to win. Super Bowl XLI was an American football game played between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Indianapolis Colts and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Chicago Bears to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2006 season. The Colts defeated the Bears by the score of 29–17. The game was played on February 4, 2007 at Dolphin Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. The National Football League playoffs for the 1987 season began on January 3, 1988. The postseason tournament concluded with the Washington Redskins defeating the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXII, 42–10, on January 31, at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego, California. A 24-day players' strike was called after Week 2. The games that were scheduled for the third week of the season were cancelled, reducing the 16-game season to 15, but the games for Weeks 4, 5 and 6 were played with replacement players, after which the union voted to end the strike. Approximately 15% of the NFLPA’s players chose to cross picket lines to play during the strike; prominent players who did so included New York Jets defensive end Mark Gastineau, Dallas Cowboys defensive tackle Randy White, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana, 49ers running back Roger Craig, New England Patriots quarterback Doug Flutie and Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Steve Largent. The replacement players were mostly those left out of work by the recent folding of the Canadian Football League’s Montreal Alouettes and the 1986 dissolution of the United States Football League, as well as others who had been preseason cuts, had long left professional football or were other assorted oddities (such as cinematographer Todd Schlopy, who, despite never playing professional football before or after the strike, served as placekicker for his hometown Buffalo Bills for three games). The replacement players, called to play on short notice and having little chance to jell as teammates, were widely treated with scorn by the press and general public, including name-calling, public shaming and accusations of being scabs. The games played by these replacement players were regarded with even less legitimacy – attendance plummeted to under 10,000 fans at many of the games in smaller markets and cities with strong union presence, including a low of 4,074 for the lone replacement game played in Philadelphia) — but nonetheless were counted as regular NFL games. Final television revenues were down by about 20%, a smaller drop than the networks had expected. The defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants went 0–3 in replacement games, ultimately costing them a chance to make the playoffs and to repeat their championship. The final replacement game was a Monday Night Football matchup on October 19, 1987, with the Washington Redskins at the Dallas Cowboys. Along with the Philadelphia Eagles, the Redskins were the only other NFL team not to have any players cross the picket line and were surprising 13–7 victors over the Cowboys who had plenty of big name players cross the picket line. This was the Saints' first Super Bowl appearance and the fourth for the Colts franchise, their second appearance in four seasons. The Saints entered the game with a 13–3 record for the 2009 regular season, compared to the Colts' 14–2 record. In the playoff games, both teams placed first in their respective conferences, marking the first time since Super Bowl XXVIII (16 years previously) that both number-one seeds have reached the Super Bowl. The Colts entered the Super Bowl off victories over the Baltimore Ravens and New York Jets, while the Saints advanced after defeating the previous year's runners up the Arizona Cardinals and then overcoming the Minnesota Vikings in the Conference Championship. It was also the first time both teams started with a thirteen-game winning streak. The 1988 NFL season was the 69th regular season of the National Football League. The Cardinals relocated from St. Louis, Missouri to the Phoenix, Arizona area becoming the Phoenix Cardinals but remained in the NFC East division. The playoff races came down to the regular season’s final week, with the Seattle Seahawks winning the AFC West by one game, and the Philadelphia Eagles and San Francisco 49ers winning their respective divisions in a five-way tie, with the New Orleans Saints and New York Giants losing the NFC Wild Card berth to the Los Angeles Rams on tiebreakers. \n",

            "passage:  Not for Children is a 1934 play by Elmer Rice. It was premiered in 1935 at the Fortune Theatre in the West End of London. The work was performed for the first time on Broadway on February 13, 1951 at the Coronet Theatre; closing four days later after only seven performances. Incidental music was composer by Robert Emmett Dolan. The production starred Elliott Nugent as Ambrose Atwater, Betty Field as Theodora Effington, J. Edward Bromberg as Timothy Forrest, Ann Thomas as Prudence Dearborn, Keene Crockett as Elijah Silverhammer, Alexander Clark as Clarence Orth, and Joan Copeland as Evangeline Orth. \"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\" (sometimes \"You've Got to Be Taught\" or \"Carefully Taught\") is a show tune from the 1949 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical South Pacific. The President of the United States decides that the true cause of the Great Depression (raging when the film was released) is a loss of \"optimism\" as a result of a plot by financiers and bankers who are getting rich from the Depression. The President then appoints Lawrence Cromwell as secretary for the newly created Department of Amusement. Cromwell creates an army of entertainers and sends them out across the country. Much of the action centers around Cromwell auditioning acts in his office (with interruptions from janitor \"George Bernard Shaw\" (played by Stepin Fetchit). At the end, as a musical production number breaks forth, Cromwell looks out of his office window and sees the Depression literally, instantaneously lift. Although \"Off the Rails\" follows the plot of \"Measure for Measure\", infamous for being one of Shakespeare's problem plays, the power struggles between the characters help rather than hurt the play's ability to send a powerful message by accentuating the racist treatment of Native Americans. Reinholz utilizes specific projection images and traditional Native American tribal songs and language in the script of the play in order to make a political statement about the horrors of Indian boarding schools. Sung by a band of players performing a musical adaption of Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\", the song has become regarded as a show business anthem on a level with \"That's Entertainment!\" (from \"The Band Wagon\") and \"There's No Business Like Show Business\" (from \"Annie Get Your Gun\"). However, it was not included in the 1953 film version of the musical. Say, Darling is a three-act comic play by Abe Burrows and Richard and Marian Bissell about the creation of a Broadway musical. Although the play featured nine original songs with lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and music by Jule Styne, all of the songs were presented as either rehearsal or audition material and not as the thoughts or feelings of the characters. The original production concept was haphazardly thrown together by Kleban's close friend and author of the book by using a trunkful of songs that Kleban had written for a number of unproduced musicals, and writing new scenes or reworking original scenes around them, with Price polishing up the results. 'Not / But, or the \"not…but\" element, is an acting technique that forms part of the Brechtian approach to performance. In its simplest form, fixing the not/but element involves the actor preceding each thought that is expressed by their character in the dialogue or each action performed by their character in the scene with its dialectical opposite. Rather than portraying a thought or action as \"naturally\" arising from the given circumstances of the scene or \"inevitably\" following from them, this technique underlines the aspect of \"decision\" in the thought or action. \"He didn't say 'come in' but 'keep moving'\", Brecht offers by way of example; \"He was not pleased but amazed\": The series was a Vaudeville-inspired variety show/comedy starring Kenny Delmar as the teacher (an earlier version, \"School Days\", had Happy Felton in the role), with such notable actors as Arnold Stang, Wally Cox, and Buddy Hackett playing the students. Theatrical cold reading is reading aloud from a script or other text with little or no rehearsal, practice or study in advance. Sometimes also referred to as sight reading, it is a technique used by actors and other performers in theatre, television, and film performance fields.  \n",

The main writer was Ben Elton, with Fry and Laurie receiving writing credits by the second series. Of the original team, Tony Slattery was supposed to join the cast for the three-part pilot \"There's Nothing to Worry About!\" in 1982, but accepted an offer from Chris Tarrant to join \"Saturday Stayback\", his follow-up to \"O.T.T.\" Snider's byline appeared in 179 separate issues. This included 75 consecutive issues from 1997 to 2003, thanks to his long-running recurring feature \"Celebrity Cause-of-Death Betting Odds\", which predicted the likeliest versions of future demise for a variety of well-known personalities. The All New Popeye Show is an American animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and King Features Syndicate. Starring the comic strip character Popeye, the series aired from 1978 to 1983 on CBS. \"F Troop\" is a satirical American television sitcom that originally aired for two seasons on ABC. The first episode aired on September 14, 1965, and the final episode aired on April 6, 1967. There were 65 episodes in all, 34 in black and white (season 1) and 31 in color (season 2). The American dramatic television series Touched by an Angel premiered on CBS on September 21, 1994 and ran for nine seasons until its conclusion on April 27, 2003. Its 212 episodes chronicled the cases of two angels, Monica (Roma Downey) and her supervisor Tess (Della Reese), who bring messages from God to various people to help them as they reach a crossroads in their lives. In the second season, the character Andrew (John Dye), was introduced as the angel of death, and in the last two seasons, a new trainee, Gloria (Valerie Bertinelli) is added to the regular cast. Chickenman was an American radio series created by Dick Orkin that spoofs comic book heroes, inspired by the mid-1960s \"Batman\" TV series. The series was created in 1966 on Chicago radio station WCFL, and was then syndicated widely, notably on Armed Forces Radio during the Vietnam War. According to public radio show, \"This American Life\", \"\"Chickenman\" first soared the radio airwaves from 1966 to 1969; nearly every day there would be a new episode. These were these short little things, each one two minutes long or so, starting on WCFL in Chicago, but spreading to over 1,500 radio stations. According to the people who syndicate \"Chickenman,\" it has been translated into German, into Dutch, into Swedish.\" Snub TV (also known as simply Snub) was an alternative culture television program that aired from 1987 to 1989 as a segment on the \"Night Flight\" overnight programming on the USA Network, and subsequently for three seasons on the BBC. \"Histeria!\" aired on Kids' WB from 1998 to 2000, which continued to air reruns until August 30, 2001. It was presented as a \"Saturday Night Live\"-style sketch comedy, with its cast often filling the roles of historical figures. It was to be WB's most ambitious project since \"Animaniacs\". Like the aforementioned series, 65 episodes were originally going to be made, but due to being $10 million over budget, only 52 episodes were completed before production of the series was canceled in March 2000. Due to the high production costs, footage from previous episode was often re-used and re-timed to match newly recorded audio, as well as several non-educational segments being used as filler. More recently, the show was aired on In2TV, first from March to July 2006, and then returning in October of that year. In January 2009, all of the episodes were taken off the site. \"MacGyver\" is an American action-adventure television series created by Lee David Zlotoff and Henry Winkler.

            "passage:  John Robert Crichton, Jr. , played by Ben Browder, is an International Aeronautics and Space Administration (most commonly referred to on the show as IASA) astronaut who, in the opening few minutes of the pilot episode, is accidentally catapulted through a wormhole across the universe, thus; setting the scene for the show as a whole. As the only regularly appearing human on the show, he is the main focus and is the main character as he narrates the weekly credits and is the only character to appear in every episode. Along with Michael Shanks' character of Daniel Jackson in \"Stargate SG-1\", Browder's Crichton has been called one of the sexiest male characters in science fiction. The pilot introduced the two main characters, Fox Mulder and Dana Scully who were portrayed by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson respectively. The episode also featured William B. Davis, Charles Cioffi and Zachary Ansley as the recurring characters of the Smoking Man, Scott Blevins and Billy Miles. The Smoking Man would go on to become the series' signature antagonist, appearing in every season except the eighth. The episode follows FBI Special Agents Mulder and Scully on their first X-File case together, investigating a string of deaths which Mulder believes to be alien experiments. \"The Incredible Hulk\" follows the story of David Banner (played by Bill Bixby), a physician/scientist who, traumatized by the loss of his wife, douses himself with dangerously high levels of gamma radiation. He metamorphosizes into a giant, green hulk (Lou Ferrigno) whenever he becomes angry. The series chronicles Banner's attempts to find a cure for himself, as he is pursued across the United States by investigative newspaper reporter Jack McGee (Jack Colvin). The series was loosely based on the Marvel comic book of the same name. Fargé portrayed Angelique \"Angel\" Smith, a pretty, young scatterbrained Frenchwoman who comes to the United States and marries a young architect, John Smith, played by Marshall Thompson. With her distinct French accent, Angel gets into various problems with the culture, language, and procedures in her new country. In the episode \"The Dentist\", for instance, she learns she must pay when late for her appointment with the dentist (played by Parley Baer in this episode). Stephen Stucker (July 2, 1947 – April 13, 1986) was an American actor, known for portrayals of bizarre, larger-than-life characters, notably the manic control-room worker Johnny in the early 1980s \"Airplane!\" movies and the crossdressing, rubber-penis-waving stenographer in the courtroom sequence of 1977's \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\". Created by Crockett Johnson, who is best known today for his children's book \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\", the strip featured a cherubic-looking five-year-old and his far-from-cherubic fairy godfather, Jackeen J. O'Malley, a short, cigar-smoking man with four tiny wings. With a distinctive appearance because of its use of typography, the strip had numerous reprints and was adapted into a 1940s stage production. The usually caustic Dorothy Parker had nothing but praise: \"I think, and I'm trying to talk calmly, that Barnaby and his friends and oppressors are the most important additions to American Arts and Letters in Lord knows how many years.\" \"Person of Interest\" is an American science fiction crime drama television series created for CBS by Jonathan Nolan, who serves as an executive producer alongside J.J. Abrams, Bryan Burk, Chris Fisher, Greg Plageman, and Denise Thé. The series stars Jim Caviezel as John Reese, a former CIA agent who is presumed dead. He is approached by a mysterious billionaire named Harold Finch (Michael Emerson) who is trying to prevent violent crimes before they happen by using an advanced surveillance system dubbed \"The Machine\" that provides the SSN of a POI (person of interest) who will be involved in an imminent lethal crime as either a perpetrator or a victim. Their unique brand of vigilante justice attracts the attention of two NYPD officers, Joss Carter (Taraji P. Henson) and Lionel Fusco (Kevin Chapman), whom Reese uses to his advantage as he investigates the POI. Reese and Finch are later aided by Samantha \"Root\" Groves (Amy Acker), a highly intelligent computer hacker and contract killer whom the Machine later identifies as its \"analog interface\", and Sameen Shaw (Sarah Shahi), a former ISA assassin who unknowingly dealt with the \"relevant\" numbers found by the Machine.  Touched by an Angel is an American supernatural drama television series that premiered on CBS on September 21, 1994, and ran for 211 episodes and nine seasons until its conclusion on April 27, 2003.

The location of the race varied: in 1998, it was held in Sydney; from 1999 to 2001, it was held in Canberra; in 2002 it was held in the Snowy Mountains and; from 2003 to 2008 it was held in Geelong, Victoria. Inaugurated in 2014 and dubbed \"The Grand Finals of Australian Racing\", The Championships is held on two days over the Easter Holiday period. The Championships have combined previous stand alone races such as the Doncaster Mile, The Australian Derby, the Queen Elizabeth Stakes and The Sydney Cup into two weekends of racing with nearly $10 million prize money on offer each Saturday. The 2015 Championships will be hosted at Royal Randwick, known as the home of Thoroughbred racing in Sydney. Racing days are 4 and 11 April 2015. It was carved out of a hill in eastern Parkes during the depression years and has evolved into one of country New South Wales' premier sporting arenas, playing host to major local, regional, national and international sporting events. However the circuit also has characteristics of a street circuit's enclosed nature due to concrete barriers annually built along the Lakeside Drive curve, in particular, where run-off is not available due to the proximity of the lake shore. Prior to its inclusion in the World Championship, it was held at a multitude of venues in every state of Australia. It was a centrepiece of the Tasman Series in most years between 1964 and 1972 and was a round of the Australian Drivers' Championship on many occasions between 1957 and 1983. It is considered to be Australia's \"premier sports precinct\" and regularly hosts some of the biggest domestic and international sporting events, including the AFL Grand Final (Australian rules football), Australian Open (tennis) and Boxing Day Test (cricket). The venues have also previously hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics (for which the Precinct served as the Olympic Park) and 2006 Commonwealth Games. The area now known as Oran Park was originally home to the Muringong, southernmost of the Darug people. In 1805 John Macarthur established his property at Camden where he raised merino sheep. The Oran Park Town housing development replaced Oran Park Raceway, which stood from 1962 - 2010. The circuit hosted the Australian Grand Prix in its pre-Formula One era and rounds of the Australian Touring Car Championship, later known as the Supercars Championship. The venue has also been the selected site for TV and film production and is the current filming location for MasterChef Australia.

The provinces and territories of Canada are the administrative divisions that are responsible for the delivery of sub-national governance within the geographical areas of Canada under the authority of the Canadian Constitution. In the 1867 Canadian Confederation, three provinces of British North America—New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which, upon Confederation, was divided into Ontario and Quebec)—were united to form a federated colony, which eventually became a sovereign nation in the next century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories. The ten provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Several of the provinces were former British colonies, and Quebec was originally a French colony, while others were added as Canada grew. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon, which govern the rest of the area of the former British North America. Together, the provinces and territories make up the world's second-largest country by area. \n",

It was played in what was then known as Rich Stadium (now called New Era Field), and was televised by NBC, with Charlie Jones and Todd Christensen calling the action. The Rams donned new uniforms, which remained in use until 1994, their final season in Los Angeles, and though they moved to St. Louis in 1995, the uniform tradition continued until 1999, where they won Super Bowl XXXIV, and wore them for Super Bowl LIII. The uniforms would return for their home games in 2018 and 2019. As of 2019, the San Francisco 49ers are in the NFC West division, while the Oakland Raiders are in the AFC West division. As a result, the two teams only meet in the regular season once every four years according to the NFL's current scheduling formula. The two teams also met occasionally in the preseason until 2011, when a fight between 49ers and Raiders fans in the parking lot of Candlestick Park escalated into a shooting, prompting the NFL to indefinitely ban all preseason games between the two teams. The Broncos were barely competitive during their 10-year run in the AFL and their first seven years in the NFL. They did not complete a winning season until 1973. In 1977, four years later, they qualified for the playoffs for the first time in franchise history and advanced to Super Bowl XII. Since 1975, the Broncos have become one of the NFL's more successful teams, having suffered only seven losing seasons. They have won eight AFC Championships (1977, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1997, 1998, 2013, 2015, and three Super Bowl championships (1997 (XXXII), 1998 (XXXIII), 2015 (50). However, the Broncos have the NFL record for most Super Bowl losses (5). They have five players in the Pro Football Hall of Fame: John Elway, Floyd Little, Gary Zimmerman, Shannon Sharpe, and the most recently elected member, Terrell Davis. Thunder is the stage name for the horse who is the official live animal mascot for the Denver Broncos football team. Three purebred Arabians have held this role since 1993, all gray horses whose coats lightened with age until they turned completely white. Sharon Magness-Blake has owned all three horses, and Ann Judge has been their rider since 1998 and trainer since 1999. , Thunder has appeared in four Super Bowls with the team since 1998. The original Thunder performed in Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII and Thunder III appeared in Super Bowl XLVIII and Super Bowl 50. Thunder III also made appearances in Times Square and on television morning news shows in New York City as part of the pre-game promotion for Super Bowl XLVIII. He routinely appears in parades, makes hospital and school visits, and attends various other public functions. He has been flown on airplanes, ridden in elevators, and appeared indoors at press conferences and banquets. The Raiders–Steelers rivalry is an NFL rivalry between the Oakland Raiders and Pittsburgh Steelers of the American Football Conference (AFC). The historically bitter rivalry started with the Steelers' first playoff win over the Raiders by way of Franco Harris's Immaculate Reception on December 23, 1972. The two teams met in the playoffs for five consecutive seasons (1972–76). The series was regarded as one of the fiercest rivalries in the history of professional sports, especially in the 1970s. As of Week 1 of the 2019 season, Oakland is one of four AFC teams with a winning overall record against Pittsburgh (the Denver Broncos, Jacksonville Jaguars, and New England Patriots are the other three). The Los Angeles Chargers are a professional American football team in the National Football League (NFL) based in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The club began play in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL), and spent its first season in Los Angeles before moving to San Diego in 1961. They returned to Los Angeles in 2017. NFL teams assign each of their players a jersey number ranging from 1 through 99. The Chargers no longer issue four retired numbers. As of 2010, the team's policy was to have the Chargers Hall of Fame committee evaluate candidates for a player's number to retire after the player has retired from the league after five years. The committee consisted of Chargers Executive Vice President A. G. Spanos, Chargers public relations director Bill Johnston, San Diego Hall of Champions founder Bob Breitbard, and the presidents of the San Diego Sports Commission and the Chargers Backers Fan Club. There are few recognized guidelines in sports regarding retiring numbers, and the NFL has no specific league policy. \"You have to have enough numbers for players to wear,\" said NFL spokesman Greg Aiello. The Chargers have rarely retired numbers. The \"San Diego Union-Tribune\" wrote, \"The [Chargers] tend to honor their heritage haphazardly.\" The Chargers–Chiefs rivalry is an American football rivalry between the National Football League (NFL)'s Los Angeles Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs. Since the American Football League (AFL) was established in 1960, the Chargers and the Chiefs have shared the same division, first being the AFL Western Conference, and since the AFL–NFL merger, the American Football Conference (AFC) West. The Chargers–Raiders rivalry is a rivalry between the Los Angeles Chargers and Oakland Raiders in the National Football League's AFC West division. Since the American Football League was established in 1960, the Chargers and the Raiders have shared the same division, first being the AFL Western Conference, and since the AFL–NFL merger, the AFC West. Kansas City is one of three teams with a winning record against all of their divisional opponents with 100-plus head-to-head games played (along with the Dallas Cowboys and the Green Bay Packers). The Los Angeles Chargers are one of only two teams with a losing record against all of their divisional opponents with 100-plus head-to-head games played (along with the Detroit Lions). This holds true as of the end of the 2018 season. \n",

The candidates were defensive ends Dwight Freeney of the Indianapolis Colts and Jason Taylor of the Miami Dolphins, and linebacker Shawne Merriman of the San Diego Chargers. Merriman was later named the cover athlete. In his book COLORS, Jim Finks Jr., son of Pro Football Hall-of-Famer Jim Finks, Sr., shows the original uniform of AFL official Jack Reader, who was a back judge in the first AFL game in 1960 and in both the first and third AFL-NFL World Championship games.

            "passage:  The term has been used since at least 1992, when \"The Washington Post\" used the term in print. Former NFL General Manager Charley Casserly attributed the curse to such factors as \"a shorter offseason, contract problems, [and] more demand for your players' time\". Casserly also noted that \"once the season starts, you become the biggest game on everybody's schedule,\" suggesting that pressure from fans and spectators may also affect a team's performance. It was the last to explicitly be endorsed by the NFL on Fox, although a knock-off/rendition of the NFL on Fox's iconic theme would continue to be used in Madden for several years afterward. The Rams donned new uniforms, which remained in use until 1994, their final season in Los Angeles, and though they moved to St. Louis in 1995, the uniform tradition continued until 1999, where they won Super Bowl XXXIV, and wore them for Super Bowl LIII. The uniforms would return for their home games in 2018 and 2019. This compromise, which was unprecedented in North American professional sports, has since been cited in franchise moves and agreements in other leagues, including ones in Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, the National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League. This redirect was created as a placeholder. Per this article should not be opened until there are sources to back further details.

Although the controversial logo Chief Wahoo has been officially removed, the Cleveland Indians remain part of the Native American mascot controversy which has led over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts to publish resolutions or policies that state that any use of Native American names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a harmful form of ethnic stereotyping that promote misunderstanding and prejudice which contributes to other problems faced by Native Americans.  The Broncos radically changed their logo and uniforms in 1997, a design that the team continues to use to this day. The new logos and uniforms were unveiled on February 4, 1997. Navy blue replaced royal blue on the team's color scheme. The current logo is a profile of a horse's head, with an orange mane and navy blue outlines. The Broncos' popular live animal mascot Thunder was the inspiration to incorporate a horse-head profile as part of the logo on the team's helmets. During a February 4, 1997 press conference introducing the new logo, the team president and the art director for Nike, who were the creators of the new design, described it as \"a powerful horse with a fiery eye and mane.\" The Los Angeles Chargers are a professional American football team in the National Football League (NFL) based in the Greater Los Angeles Area.

Two of these games, the 1974 Chicago College All-Star Game and the 2011 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, were cancelled because of off-season labor stoppages that were resolved prior to the start of the rest of the preseason. Three games were canceled as the result of unsafe playing fields: a 1995 NFL preseason game between the San Diego Chargers and the Houston Oilers, a 2001 preseason game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Philadelphia Eagles, and the 2016 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. An additional preseason game, the 2017 Texas Governor's Cup, was cancelled for weather. At least one other announced game was discarded before it was officially placed on the schedule. The proposed China Bowl exhibition was to have been played in August 2007 but was postponed indefinitely before the 2007 schedule was released, with all plans for the game formally canceled before December 2008. \n",

            "passage:  Jeff Burton won the pole position by posting the fastest lap in qualifying, and held his start line advantage for the next seven laps until Kasey Kahne passed him. Burton retook the lead from Kahne on the next lap, and led the most laps out of any one else (87) as the lead of the race changed eighteen times by nine different drivers. After falling to 39th because of a flat left-front tire on the 39th lap, Johnson recovered lost ground by maneuvering his way through traffic. He became the new leader on lap 117 after overtaking Harvick. Johnson led for a total of 38 laps en route to his fourth victory of the season, his first at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and the 22nd of his career. It was the third race to feature the Car of Tomorrow. Hendrick Motorsports was shooting for its fifth consecutive win as a team. The last team to accomplish this feat was Petty Enterprises in 1971. HMS driver Jeff Gordon started from pole as qualifying was rained out. The race itself featured many attritions, including a hard first lap crash involving David Ragan, J.J. Yeley, and Ricky Rudd. Gordon dominated the early part of the race until a pit mistake forced him to lose the lead. November Texas winner Tony Stewart struggled throughout the day, first being spun out after contact with rookie Juan Pablo Montoya, and being hit by Jimmie Johnson in the driver's side, and spun again later. However, Dale Earnhardt Jr., who got his first cup win at Texas, slowed to avoid the spinning Stewart, but was hit from behind by Kyle Busch, who was traveling over 30 mph faster. In the end, the race came down to former Texas Motor Speedway winners and ex-teammates Matt Kenseth and Jeff Burton. Burton attempted many times to pass Kenseth low, but he held the top spot. On the last lap, however, Burton was able to get underneath and clear Kenseth off turn 2 and hold him off to become the first repeat winner of a Cup series event held at the speedway. The 2007 Sharp AQUOS 500 was the 25th race of the 2007 NASCAR Nextel Cup season, and was held on Sunday, September 2, 2007, at California Speedway near Fontana, California, 50 miles east of Los Angeles. After this race, only one more race remained before the field is set for the 2007 Chase for the Nextel Cup, and through the Bristol race, five drivers - Jeff Gordon, Denny Hamlin, Matt Kenseth. Carl Edwards and Tony Stewart - have clinched spots in NASCAR's \"playoff series\". Joe Nemechek would defeat Ricky Rudd by just one car length (.081 of a second) in front of 90,000 fans. Nemechek won the pole position for the race at just over during Friday's qualifying session. The race took three hours to complete and nine caution periods slowed the race for 39 laps. The race began at approximately 2:00 PM EDT and concluded at approximately 5:07 PM EDT. At an interview done in 2012, Nemechek praised NASCAR's then-lenient rules on \"vehicle innovation\" that allowed him to acquire his fourth (and final) NASCAR Cup Series victory. The 2010 Autism Speaks 400 presented by Hershey's Milk & Milkshakes was the twelfth race of the 2010 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season held at Dover International Speedway in Dover, Delaware. The race started at 1 p.m. EST on May 16, 2010 and was broadcast on Fox and MRN radio starting at 12 p.m. Martin Truex, Jr. started in the pole position. The race had eight different leaders, twenty lead changes, and five cautions. The winner of the race was Kyle Busch, while Jeff Burton and Matt Kenseth finished second and third respectively. The race was telecast on Fox starting at 7:45 pm US EDT, with radio coverage on Sirius Satellite Radio and MRN beginning at 7:30 pm US EDT. The race is named for Columbiana, Ohio resident Dan Lowry, who was the winner of an essay contest sponsored by race sponsor Crown Royal whisky. Clint Bowyer won the race. Qualifying was cancelled on March 24 due to snow, sleet and rain, and the field was set with top 35 owners points from 2005, the Champion's Provisional (for Terry Labonte) and seven others, based on qualifying attempts in 2006. As a result, 2005 champion Tony Stewart sat on the pole. Pole position driver Kasey Kahne maintained his lead into the first corner to begin the race, but Jimmie Johnson, who started in the second position on the grid, took the lead before the first lap was over. Afterward, Greg Biffle became the leader, and would eventually lead to the race high of 66 laps. Tony Stewart led after the final pit stops, ahead of Hamlin and Harvick. Harvick helped Hamlin to become the leader, but with twelve laps left, Harvick gained on Hamlin and claimed the first position with eleven laps remaining. Harvick maintained his position to claim his first Sprint Cup victory at Michigan International Speedway. Second-year driver, 23-year-old Jeff Gordon from nearby Pittsboro, was cheered on by the hometown crowd to a popular win. It was his second career NASCAR Winston Cup win, and thrust the young Gordon into superstardom on the racing circuit. Body styles and engines were the story of the second race of the Nextel Cup season. Kurt Busch won the pole (187.086 mph) using a 2004 Dodge Intrepid-styled body, as opposed to the new Dodge Charger, which his Penske Racing team believed was aerodynamically superior. Bobby Labonte and the #43 team ran the Intrepid as well. Others, including Evernham Motorsports drivers Jeremy Mayfield and Kasey Kahne, drove the Charger. \n",

            "passage:  The show was cancelled after one season. The fourth season of \"iCarly\" began airing on Nickelodeon July 30, 2010, and ended on June 11, 2011. The season features Carly Shay (Miranda Cosgrove), Sam Puckett (Jennette McCurdy) and Freddie Benson (Nathan Kress) as their own Web Show iCarly is becoming more popular worldwide. Jerry Trainor co-stars as Carly's big brother Spencer. Noah Munck joins the main cast this season as Gibby Gibson. The specials of the season include \"iGot a Hot Room\", \"iSam's Mom\", \"iDo\", \"iStart a Fan War\", \"iOMG\", and \"iParty With Victorious\". The Smoke is a British drama that debuted on Sky1 on 20 February 2014. The show is written by Lucy Kirkwood and stars Jamie Bamber, Taron Egerton, Jodie Whittaker and Rhashan Stone. As creator of the show, Matt Nix serves as executive producer and often writes episodes for the show. He made his directorial debut with the season two episode \"Do No Harm\", which he had also written. Seven seasons have completed airing in the United States, with 12 episodes in the first season, 16 episodes in the second and third seasons, and 18 episodes in the fourth season. The fourth season introduced new regular character Jesse Porter (Coby Bell), a counterintelligence agent whom Michael unintentionally burns but later makes part of his team. In October 2009, USA Networks announced the renewal of the series for seasons 5 and 6. The show's fifth season, comprising 18 episodes, began airing June 23, 2011, and entered a mid-season break after twelve episodes on September 8, 2011. The remaining episodes aired in November and December 2011, for a finale on December 15, 2011. The program concluded its 18-episode sixth season, which premiered on June 14, 2012, and ended on December 20, 2012, with a two-hour finale. On November 7, 2012, USA Networks renewed \"Burn Notice\" for a seventh season, and, on May 10, 2013, announced that it would be the series' final season. The seventh season premiered on June 6, 2013, and the series reached its 100th episode with \"Forget Me Not\", the second episode of that season. The series finale aired on September 12, 2013. A total of 111 episodes of \"Burn Notice\" were broadcast over seven seasons. Under the Dome came to a conclusion in September 2015. Over three seasons, 39 episodes were produced. Executive producer and showrunner Neal Baer stated in an interview after the finale aired: \"I'm very happy with this ending. I feel very satisfied. We made it so there could be another (season)... but it wasn't necessary.\" In seasons 1 through 3, House's diagnostic team includes Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps). This team leaves the show in the third season finale \"Human Error\". The show achieved its highest ranking with the episode \"Human Error\"; this episode placed the series in first position for the week it aired. Each season introduces a recurring guest star, who appears in a multi-episode story arc. The fourth season was the only exception to this pattern. It introduced seven new characters who compete for the coveted positions on House's team, replacing Cameron, Chase and Foreman. House eventually selects Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn) and Dr. Remy \"Thirteen\" Hadley (Olivia Wilde) as his new team; Foreman rejoins soon after. Following Kutner's death in season five, through a series of plot twists, House reacquires Chase, one of the original team members. \"Smoke\" is the fourth season premiere of the AMC television series \"Better Call Saul\", the spinoff series of \"Breaking Bad\". The episode aired on August 6, 2018 on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries. On May 10, 2018, NBC renewed the series for a fourth season, which premiered on October 12, 2018. On May 10, 2019, NBC renewed the series for a fifth and final season of 13 episodes.  Spillman's appearance as host (the Season 3 Christmas episode, also featuring Buck Henry) began with a joke involving herself and cast member John Belushi sharing a joint, followed by a marijuana-induced obsession with a bowl of fruit (going so far as to swat away Henry's hands whenever he tried to grab the bowl). The fourth season of \"House\", also known as House, M.D., premiered on September 25, 2007 and ended May 19, 2008. Having previously fired Chase, and with Foreman and Cameron quitting, House starts a competition between 40 applicants for the vacant positions. He eventually narrows them down to seven, firing one each episode. In the episode \"Games\", he fires Amber \"Cutthroat Bitch\" Volakis (Anne Dudek), hiring Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn) and Dr. Remy \"Thirteen\" Hadley (Olivia Wilde) as his new team. Dr. Foreman rejoins the team after his dismissal from another hospital. Meanwhile, Amber begins a relationship with Wilson. \n",

            "passage:  The team began as the Boston Yanks, owned by Kate Smith's manager, Ted Collins. He wanted a team in New York City, but had to be content with one in Boston after the New York Giants refused to let his new team share the New York area. In 1949, however, Collins, suspecting that the All-America Football Conference was on its last legs, got permission to move to New York. Rather than a formal relocation, however, Collins asked the NFL to fold his Boston franchise and grant him a new one for New York—most likely as a tax write-off. This new team played as the New York Bulldogs and shared the Polo Grounds with the Giants during the 1949 season. The Major League Baseball (MLB) season schedule consists of 162 games for each of the 30 teams in the American League (AL) and National League (NL), played over approximately six months—a total of 2,430 games, plus the postseason. The regular season runs from late March/early April to late September/early October, followed by the postseason which can run to early November. The season begins with the official Opening Day, and, as of 2018, runs 26½ weeks through the last Sunday of September or first Sunday of October. One or more International Opener games may be scheduled outside the United States before the official Opening Day. It is possible for a given team to play a maximum of 20 games in the postseason in a given year, provided the team is a wild card and advances to each of the Division Series, Championship Series, and World Series with each series going the distance (5 games in the Division Series, 7 games each in the League Championship Series/World Series). The Washington Redskins are a professional American football team based in the Washington metropolitan area. The Redskins compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The team plays its home games at FedExField in Landover, Maryland; its headquarters and training facility are at Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Ashburn, Virginia, and the Redskins Complex in Richmond, Virginia, respectively. The Redskins have played more than 1,000 games since 1932, and are one of only five franchises in the NFL to record over 600 regular season and postseason wins, reaching that mark in 2015. The Redskins have won five NFL Championships (two pre-1966 merger announcement, and three Super Bowls). The franchise has captured 14 NFL divisional titles and six NFL conference championships. The Redskins were the first team in the NFL with an official marching band, and also the first team to have a fight song, \"Hail to the Redskins\". Because of a shortage of players caused by World War II, the Yanks were temporarily merged with the Brooklyn Tigers for the 1945 season, and styled as just the Yanks with no home city named. The merged team played four home games in Boston and one in New York and finished with a losing 3–6–1 record. The Brooklyn Tigers and the Boston Yanks merged for this one season. The combined team, known simply as The Yanks, played four games at Boston's Fenway Park and one game at New York's Yankee Stadium. After Brooklyn Tigers owner Dan Topping announced his intentions to join the new All-America Football Conference, his NFL team was immediately revoked after the season and all of its players were assigned to the Boston Yanks. The 1945 Yanks season was their second in the National Football League. They merged with the Brooklyn Tigers for the season and played under the name Yanks. The team improved on their previous season's output of 2–8, winning three games. They failed to qualify for the playoffs for the second consecutive season. Four home games were played in Boston and the home game against the New York Giants was played at Yankee Stadium. The game matched the New York Giants (7–3–1), champions of the Eastern Division, against the Western Division champion Chicago Bears (8–2–1). The Giants had won the regular season game at the Polo Grounds seven weeks earlier on October 27, but the Bears were seven to ten point  The Brooklyn Tigers delayed their start of the 1936 season as the team started as essentially a traveling team, with the Tigers playing their first game on October 11 (in Week Four of the league schedule); while Ebbets Field was designated the Tigers' home stadium, the only AFL game scheduled to be played there was moved to Yankee Stadium to accommodate a large anticipated crowd for the Tigers' November 1 game against the New York Yankees.  After finishing fourth in the AFL’s season of 1940, the Yankees were sold to agent and promoter Douglas Hertz. By the summer of 1941, the team’s AFL franchise was revoked in light of a scandal involving the new owner, and a group headed by William Cox assumed control of the team by the beginning of the new season. The newly renamed New York Americans were competitive, finishing one-half game behind league champions Columbus Bullies. While the Americans were making plans for a 1942 AFL season, the league suspended operations in the wake of the entry of the United States into World War II, and the Americans followed suit. The league did not return to business after the end of the war, and neither did the New York Americans. The Boston Yanks were a National Football League team based in Boston, Massachusetts, that played from 1944 to 1948. The team played its home games at Fenway Park. Any games that conflicted with the Boston Red Sox baseball schedule in the American League were held at Braves Field of the cross-town National League team, the Boston Braves. Team owner Ted Collins, who managed singer and TV show host Kate Smith (1907–1986), for thirty years, picked the name \"Yanks\" because he originally wanted to run a team that played at New York City's old Yankee Stadium. The Yanks could manage only a losing 2–8 record during their first regular season. \n",

New York Giants-turned-Yankees also included end Les Borden and back Stu Clancy. The 1937 edition of the Yankees was never truly in the running as league newcomers Los Angeles Bulldogs were the only AFL team with a winning record as Los Angeles dominated the league with an unbeaten, untied 8-0-0 record (the Yankees finished in third place for the second straight year, this time with 2-3-1).  The Yankees appeared in the 1946 AAFC championship game, but lost to the Cleveland Browns by a score of 14–9. The same two teams appeared in the championship game the following year, with the Browns winning again 14–3. It matched the Western Division champion Kansas City Chiefs (11–2–1) and the Eastern Division champion Buffalo Bills (9–4–1) to decide the American Football League (AFL) champion for the 1966 season. The team began play as the Boston Braves in 1932, based in Boston, before relocating to Washington, D.C., in 1937. The Redskins won the 1937 and 1942 Championship games, as well as Super Bowls XVII, XXII, and XXVI. They also played in, and lost, the 1936, 1940, 1943, and 1945 Championship games, as well as Super Bowls VII and XVIII. They have made 24 postseason appearances, and have an overall postseason record of 23–18. The Redskins' three Super Bowl wins are tied with the Oakland Raiders and Denver Broncos, behind the Pittsburgh Steelers (six), San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys, and New England Patriots (five each), and the Green Bay Packers and New York Giants (four each). The 1942 World Series featured the defending champion New York Yankees against the St. Louis Cardinals, with the Cardinals winning the Series in five games for their first championship since and their fourth overall. The National League pennant race ended in a tie between the St. Louis Cardinals and Brooklyn Dodgers and was decided by an unprecedented best-of-three playoff. St. Louis won the series, 2–0. Because of a shortage of players caused by World War II, the Yanks were temporarily merged with the Brooklyn Tigers for the 1945 season, and styled as just the Yanks with no home city named. The merged team played four home games in Boston and one in New York and finished with a losing 3–6–1 record. The Patriots' victory was their fifth, and moved them into a three-way tie with the Dallas Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers for second place on the all-time Super Bowl wins list, and at that time, trailing only the Pittsburgh Steelers who have six victories. New England, after finishing the regular season with a league-best 14–2 record, advanced to their record-setting ninth Super Bowl appearance, their second in three years, and their seventh under the leadership of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. The Falcons entered the game after completing an 11–5 regular season record, and were trying to win their first Super Bowl title, having lost their only previous appearance in Super Bowl XXXIII. \n",

            "passage:  The film stars Malcolm McDowell in his first screen role and his first appearance as Anderson's \"everyman\" character Mick Travis. Richard Warwick, Christine Noonan, David Wood, and Robert Swann also star. Two brothers, Hugh (Monte Blue) and Dan Clayton (Robert Ober), love their father's secretary, Phyllis Jones (Edna Murphy). She chooses Hugh, and they marry before he goes to war as a pilot. Shot down in France, he loses his memory and becomes a drifter. Eight years later, Phyllis, resigned to her fate, promises to marry Dan after a visit to the place in France where Hugh was last seen.  The race begins at West Quoddy Head Lighthouse, which is the easternmost point in the United States.  The film received generally poor reviews, but received wide viewership for Dorothy Dandridge's role. Filming took place in southern California aboard the Chios, Greece-registered SS \"Igor\" (originally the \"Philip C. Shera\"), a World War II Liberty Ship owned by the Los and Pezas shipowning families. The 1940 race was won by Jacomar, recorded as being owned by Mrs. E. Graham Lewis. Better known as the highly successful cosmetics magnate Elizabeth Arden, she would establish Maine Chance Farm three years later and build it into one of the most successful breeding and racing operations of that era. The film was shot on board RMS Baltic and in New York and Ireland during summer 1911. In December 2010, it was announced that a film based on the novel If I Stay was in the works at Summit Entertainment and that Dakota Fanning, Chloë Grace Moretz and Emily Browning were in talks to play Mia. Catherine Hardwicke was attached to direct, but was replaced by Brazilian filmmaker Heitor Dhalia, who also left the film later. On January 24, 2013, Moretz was officially cast to play the lead and R. J. Cutler was announced as the new director of the film. The shooting of the film began on October 30 in Vancouver. The Decks Ran Red (also called Infamy) is a 1958 MGM seagoing suspense drama based on the book \"Infamy at Sea\", and directed by Andrew L. Stone. The feature starred James Mason, Dorothy Dandridge, Broderick Crawford, and Stuart Whitman. In a typical race, the fleet enters the Atlantic and the Gulf Stream, with rough water, giving the race its nickname, \"The Thrash to the Onion Patch.\" Once through the rough Gulf Stream, the sailors press on to the finish off St. David's Lighthouse, then winding channel to Hamilton, Bermuda to the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club. The Tiburon is named for the once fishing village across the San Francisco Bay from the track. The word \"tiburon\" is Spanish for \"shark.\" \n",

            "passage:  In baseball, a pitch is the act of throwing a baseball toward home plate to start a play. The term comes from the Knickerbocker Rules. Originally, the ball had to be literally \"pitched\" underhand, as with pitching horseshoes. Overhand throwing was not allowed until 1884. Starlin DeJesus Castro (born March 24, 1990) is a Dominican professional baseball second baseman who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago Cubs, New York Yankees and Miami Marlins. Castro is a four-time MLB All-Star and holds the record for most runs batted in in an MLB debut. In 2011, he led the National League in hits, becoming the youngest player to do so. In baseball, a bat flip is the throwing of a baseball bat in such a way that it rotates several times before landing. It is typically done by a batter to show off after hitting a home run. This is in contrast to the usual practice of dropping the bat straight down as the batter begins running to first base. Raúl Adalberto Mondesí (born July 27, 1995) is a Dominican-American professional baseball shortstop for the Kansas City Royals of Major League Baseball (MLB). He is the first player in modern MLB history to make his debut in the World Series, doing so with the Royals in Game 3 on October 30, 2015, against the New York Mets. The 2000 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 71st playing of the midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 11, 2000 at Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia, home of the Atlanta Braves of the National League.  \"World Class Baseball\" features 12 teams that must be defeated in the single player Pennant Mode, a knockout competition. Upon defeating all teams, the player faces off against the Turbo Tigers, a non-player selectable team of all-stars. The game also gives the option for players to compete in a one or two player versus exhibition game, or to watch two computer controlled teams play each other. In the first inning, Alex Rodriguez elected to switch to third base so Cal Ripken, Jr. could play his original shortstop position, which the crowd applauded. The move allowed Ripken to set the record for most MLB All-star appearances at shortstop (15). Seattle's own Ichiro Suzuki gave his hometown fans something to cheer for early, when in the first, he singled off starter (and former Mariner) Randy Johnson, and then stole second. Randy Johnson stranded him at second to hold the AL scoreless in the first inning. Ripken followed this with a home run in the third inning, which also got a standing ovation, to put the AL up 1–0. Sidearm is a common way of throwing the ball in the infield, because many throws must be made hurriedly from the glove after fielding ground balls. An infielder's quickest throw to the bases is often from just above ground level, necessitating a horizontal release of the ball. In roughly the middle of the square, equidistant between first and third base, and a few feet closer to home plate than to second base, is a low artificial hill called the pitcher's mound. This is where the pitcher stands when throwing the pitch. Atop the mound is a white rubber slab, called the pitcher's plate or pitcher's rubber. It measures 6 inches (15 cm) front-to-back and 2 feet (61 cm) across, the front of which is exactly 60 feet 6 inches (18.44 m) from the rear point of home plate. This peculiar distance was set by the rule makers in 1893, not due to a clerical or surveying error as popular myth has it, but intentionally (further details in History section). Overall rules and baserunning is roughly similar to basic forms of baseball, but there are only two bases in addition to home plate, only two or three fielders, a broomstick is used as a bat and a large plastic water bottle cap, called \"la vitilla\", is used instead of a ball. The game also has aspects of Cricket, in that there are no walks or looking strike counts and strikeouts can be made by hitting a target behind the batter.  \n",

News outlets noted the irony of the logo's final appearance being on Indigenous Peoples' Day/Columbus Day. The 2016 Los Angeles Rams season was the franchise's 79th season in the National Football League and the fifth and final under head coach Jeff Fisher. It was the franchise's 50th season in the Greater Los Angeles Area and the first since 1994. The team returned to Los Angeles after 21 seasons in St. Louis. The Rams decided from 2016-2019 to return to wearing white uniforms at home in LA as a nod to Fearsome Foursome era. In Week 15 against their NFC West Rival the Seattle Seahawks, the Rams used white horns on their helmet just for the one game only, a move which would be repeated for the entire following season. The professional American football team now known as the Oakland Raiders played in Los Angeles, California as the Los Angeles Raiders from 1982 to 1994 before relocating back to Oakland where the team played from its inaugural 1960 season to the 1981 season. The Raiders franchise relocated from Oakland to Los Angeles in 1982. The Raiders first home game in Los Angeles was at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum against the San Diego Chargers on November 22, 1982 after a 57 day player strike. Their last game as a Los Angeles-based club was played at the Coliseum against the Kansas City Chiefs on December 24, 1994, a game in which they lost 19–9 eliminating them from playoff competition. The 2016 Oakland Raiders season was the 57th overall of the Oakland Raiders franchise, the franchise's 47th season in the National Football League, their 22nd season since their return to Oakland, and the second under head coach Jack Del Rio. The Raiders improved on a 7–9 campaign in 2015 and finished with a winning record for the first time since 2002, finishing the regular season with a 12–4 record. The 2009 Oakland Raiders season was the 50th season for the original American Football League team, and its 40th in the NFL. On September 6, 2009, The Raiders traded a 2011 draft pick to the New England Patriots for ×5 Pro Bowl Defensive Lineman Richard Seymour. With their loss to Dallas on November 26, 2009, The Raiders sealed their seventh consecutive losing season. After beating the Pittsburgh Steelers on December 6, 2009, the Raiders moved to 4–0 when playing Pittsburgh the year they won the Super Bowl, or are the defending Champions, winning in 1974, 1980, 2006, and now 2009. In 1999, the Eagles hired head coach Andy Reid and drafted quarterback Donovan McNabb. From 1999 until 2004, the team continually improved, going from 5–11 in 1999, returning to the playoffs in with an 11–5 record in 2000, surpassing the Buccaneers in the Wild Card round before losing in the divisional. Moreover, the Eagles played in four straight NFC Championship Games between 2001 and 2004. In 2001, the Eagles stayed at 11–5, beating the Buccaneers and Bears to advance to the NFC championship, where they lost to the St. Louis Rams. In 2002, the Eagles drafted running back Brian Westbrook, got the 1st round bye with the 2nd seed in the NFC with a 12–4 record, but the Tampa Bay Buccaneers got their revenge in the Championship and eliminated the Eagles. In 2003, they won the NFC first seed, but Westbrook went down in Week 17, culminating in a loss to the Carolina Panthers in their 3rd straight NFC Championship. In 2004, the Philadelphia Eagles had their best season since 1960, going 13–1 before resting their starters and losing their next 2, clinching the 1st seed for the second year in a row. McNabb set career highs, completing 64% of his passes for 3,875 yards, though he didn't play all 16 games. McNabb became the first quarterback ever to throw more than 30 touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions in a season. His success could be attributed to the fact that he had a reliable receiver, Terrell Owens, who got 1,200 yards and 14 touchdowns in 14 games. After beating the Vikings and Falcons the Eagles advanced to Super Bowl XXXIX, where they dueled the New England Patriots. Although McNabb threw 3 touchdown passes and 357 yards in the game, and the score was tied 14–14 going into the fourth quarter, the Patriots outscored the Eagles and scored ten straight points. McNabb completed a 30-yard touchdown pass, and the Eagles defense held the Patriots to a 3 and out, but a crucial interception with 46 seconds left on the clock secured their fate. The Eagles have never appeared in a Super Bowl since, but this was their closest one at winning. The Raiders' off-field fortunes have varied considerably over the years. The team's first three years of operation (1960–1962) were marred by poor on-field performance, financial difficulties, and spotty attendance. In 1963, however, the Raiders' fortunes improved dramatically with the introduction of head coach (and eventual owner) Al Davis. In 1967, after several years of improvement, the Raiders reached the postseason for the first time. The team would go on to win its first (and only) AFL Championship that year; in doing so, the Raiders advanced to Super Bowl II, where they were soundly defeated by the Green Bay Packers. Since 1963, the team has won 15 division titles (3 AFL and 12 NFL), 4 AFC Championships (1976, 1980, 1983, and 2002), 1 AFL Championship (1967), and 3 Super Bowl Championships (XI, XV, and XVIII). At the end of the NFL's 2018 season, the Raiders boasted a lifetime regular season record of 466 wins, 423 losses, and 11 ties; their lifetime playoff record currently stands at 25 wins and 19 losses. On March 9, 2016, the NFL announced that the Chiefs had violated the league's anti-tampering policy, while pursuing wide receiver Jeremy Maclin during the 2015 off-season. The NFL defines tampering as prospective teams contacting soon-to-be free agents before NFL policies allow, which is two days prior to the beginning of the new league year. As punishment, the Chiefs forfeited their 2016 third-round selection, a 2017 sixth-round selection, and were fined $250,000. In addition, head coach Andy Reid was fined $75,000 and general manager John Dorsey was fined $25,000. The Chiefs immediately appealed the decision believing the punishment was excessively harsh and inconsistent with punishments that have given to other teams in similar situations. On April 19, the NFL denied the Chiefs appeal however they did reduce the team's fine to $200,000 and Reid's fine to $60,000. The Oakland Athletics' 1988 season involved the A's winning their first American League West title since 1981, with a record of 104 wins and 58 losses. In 1988, the elephant was restored as the symbol of the Athletics and currently adorns the left sleeve of home and road uniforms. The elephant was retired as team mascot in 1963 by then-owner Charles O. Finley in favor of a Missouri mule. The A's defeated the Boston Red Sox in the ALCS, but lost the World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games, including a dramatic, classic walk-off home run by the Dodgers' Kirk Gibson in game one. The Rams donned new uniforms, which remained in use until 1994, their final season in Los Angeles, and though they moved to St. Louis in 1995, the uniform tradition continued until 1999, where they won Super Bowl XXXIV, and wore them for Super Bowl LIII. The uniforms would return for their home games in 2018 and 2019. \n",

            "passage:  The Raiders' off-field fortunes have varied considerably over the years. The team's first three years of operation (1960–1962) were marred by poor on-field performance, financial difficulties, and spotty attendance. In 1963, however, the Raiders' fortunes improved dramatically with the introduction of head coach (and eventual owner) Al Davis. In 1967, after several years of improvement, the Raiders reached the postseason for the first time. The team would go on to win its first (and only) AFL Championship that year; in doing so, the Raiders advanced to Super Bowl II, where they were soundly defeated by the Green Bay Packers. Since 1963, the team has won 15 division titles (3 AFL and 12 NFL), 4 AFC Championships (1976, 1980, 1983, and 2002), 1 AFL Championship (1967), and 3 Super Bowl Championships (XI, XV, and XVIII). At the end of the NFL's 2018 season, the Raiders boasted a lifetime regular season record of 466 wins, 423 losses, and 11 ties; their lifetime playoff record currently stands at 25 wins and 19 losses. The National Football Conference (NFC) is one of two conferences within the National Football League (NFL), the American Football Conference (AFC) being the other. Prior to 1970, there were two separate professional football leagues, the National Football League and the American Football League (AFL). In 1970, the AFL merged with the NFL. As part of the merger, the former AFL teams, plus three former NFL teams (the Baltimore Colts, the Cleveland Browns and the Pittsburgh Steelers), were placed into the AFC. The remaining former NFL teams were placed in the NFC. As of the 2018 season only the Detroit Lions have not won an NFC championship. The Rams donned new uniforms, which remained in use until 1994, their final season in Los Angeles, and though they moved to St. Louis in 1995, the uniform tradition continued until 1999, where they won Super Bowl XXXIV, and wore them for Super Bowl LIII. The uniforms would return for their home games in 2018 and 2019. Clarence Fred Gehrke (April 24, 1918 – February 9, 2002) was an American football player and executive. He played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Cleveland / Los Angeles Rams, San Francisco 49ers and Chicago Cardinals from 1940 through 1950. To boost team morale, Gehrke designed and painted the Los Angeles Rams logo in 1948, which was the first painted on the helmets of an NFL team. He later served as the general manager of the Denver Broncos from 1977 through 1981. He is the great-grandfather of Milwaukee Brewers left fielder, and 2018 NL MVP Christian Yelich. Chester Morise Pitts II (born June 26, 1979) is a former American football offensive lineman of the National Football League.

The team is set to relocate from Oakland to Las Vegas, Nevada, prior to the 2020 NFL season, pending the completion of Allegiant Stadium. If construction of Allegiant Stadium is delayed, the Raiders have a stadium option to remain in Oakland for the 2020 season.  Super Bowl XI was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Oakland Raiders and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Minnesota Vikings to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for its 1976 season. The Raiders defeated the Vikings by the score of 32–14 to win their first Super Bowl. The game was played on January 9, 1977, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.

Eight players held a share of the lead in the last round including Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy. McIlroy had at least a share of the lead for the first three rounds and had a four stroke advantage entering Sunday's final round, but shot an 80 to finish ten strokes behind Schwartzel. The following is a list of golfers who have been top of the Official World Golf Ranking. As of June 17, 2018, Dustin Johnson is the number one ranked golfer. Tiger Woods has spent the most consecutive weeks (281) and most total weeks (683) in that position. Three golfers have spent an entire calendar year atop the rankings: Nick Faldo (1993), Greg Norman (1996), and Woods (2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009). The Asian Masters was one of two Asian Tour events in India that year alongside the Hero Honda Indian Open. The prize fund was US$400,000 and the winner was Hendrik Buhrmann of South Africa, who finally won his first Asian Tour event after eleven years of trying. The only players eligible to compete who did not enter were six-time champion Tiger Woods (on an indefinite break from golf) and Ryo Ishikawa (graduating from high school). The draw was led by the defending champion Tomáš Berdych, Russian Mikhail Youzhny and Croatian Marin Čilić. The year's tournament saw a couple of withdrawals; The women's side saw the draw without the top two rank players with World no. 2 Dinara Safina withdrawing with a recurring back problem and world no. 1 Serena Williams with sister Venus Williams continue their boycott from the tournament since Serena won the event in 2001.

After the restoration of Lithuanian independence in 1990, the national team was resurrected, with their first official tournament being the 1992 Olympics, where they won a bronze medal. The Lithuanians have since won another two bronzes at the Olympics, a bronze medal at the 2010 FIBA World Championship, and five EuroBasket medals, including the country's third title at FIBA EuroBasket 2003 in Sweden.

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional men's basketball league, consisting of 30 teams in North America (29 in the United States and one in Canada). The NBA was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA). It adopted the name National Basketball Association at the start of the 1949–50 season when it absorbed the National Basketball League (NBL). The NBA is an active member of USA Basketball, which is recognized by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) as the National Governing Body (NGB) for basketball in the country. The league is considered to be one of the four major professional sports leagues of North America. The Lithuanian national team won the last EuroBasket tournaments prior to World War II, in 1937 and 1939. The 1939 team was led by Frank Lubin, who helped popularize basketball in the country and was called the \"grandfather of Lithuanian basketball\". Following the country's annexation by the Soviet Union during the war, Lithuanian players frequently formed the core of the Soviet national team. The most prevalent example was the 1988 Olympic basketball gold medal-winning team, which got most of its scoring from four Lithuanians: Valdemaras Chomičius, Rimas Kurtinaitis, Šarūnas Marčiulionis and Arvydas Sabonis.

Linda Bassett, Charlotte Ritchie, Kate Lamb, Jennifer Kirby, Annabelle Apsion and Leonie Elliott. The series is produced by Neal Street Productions, a production company founded and owned by the film director and producer Sam Mendes, Call the Midwife executive producer Pippa Harris, and Caro Newling. The first series, set in 1957, premiered in the UK on 15 January 2012. The Laya Healthcare City Spectacular (formerly Street Performance World Championship) is an annual street performance competition, jointly hosted by Cork and Dublin in Ireland. Set in Port Talbot and Swansea, the Lewis \"twins\" of the title are not twins but brothers. They live with their parents and sister Adie in a caravan on a mobile home site. Constantly mocking their sister's employment at a local massage parlour, they spend most of their time joking around, taking drugs and stealing cars. The Call Centre is a BBC fly-on-the-wall documentary following staff at the call centre of a Welsh company called Save Britain Money. Although now in administration at the time of filming the call centre was described as Swansea's third largest. Two series plus a Christmas special have aired on BBC 3, in total 12 episodes, beginning in 2013 and concluding in 2014. The story is set in the Rhondda Valley in the early 1930s. It chronicles the trials and tribulations of the peoples, set against the backdrop of the aftermath of the General Strike and the Great Depression in the South Wales Valleys. It is principally seen through the eyes of a newly ordained chapel minister, the Reverend Dan Price. The show focused on boss Neville (Nev) Wilshire whose management style led to comparisons of fictional manager David Brent from mockumentary \"The Office\". Wilshire famously opened the working day with a mass sing-along, and claimed he'd previously sacked two people for not participating. A break-out star amongst the staff was tea-lady Hayley Pearce. Pearce eventually opened a cafe (which she shut within a year) and presented a number of shows for BBC. In 2016, she presented a show on 'tanorexia' - an over-reliance on fake tan. In late 2016, a three part show called \"Hayley\" was released online on BBC3 (iPlayer), before airing on BBC One in January 2017. The show looked at issues facing the youth including cosmetic enhancement, boozy holidays and dating apps. Camp Bestival is a British music festival, the \"little sister\" of Bestival, both organised by BBC Radio 1 DJ Rob Da Bank.

It won the Best New Festival award from the UK Festival Awards in 2008 and Best Family Festival in 2009, 2010, 2013 and 2014. Twin Town is a 1997 British dark crime comedy drama film filmed and set in Swansea, Wales. It was directed by Kevin Allen and had a working title of \"Hot Dog\"; a hot dog van features in a number of scenes in the film. It stars real-life brothers Rhys Ifans (in his first major movie role) and Llŷr Ifans (credited as Llyr Evans) along with Dougray Scott. The director appears on screen, briefly seen as a show host on a TV set in the static caravan home of the twins while co-writer Paul Durden briefly appears as a rude taxi driver. \n",

            "passage:  The Coca-Cola London Eye, the Millennium Wheel, or simply just the London Eye, is a cantilevered observation wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London. It is Europe's tallest cantilevered observation wheel, and is the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom with over 3.75 million visitors annually, and has made many appearances in popular culture. The Wheel of Manchester was a transportable Ferris wheel installation at Piccadilly Gardens, Manchester, England. The wheel was originally a smaller installation based in Exchange Square, first assembled in 2004. The wheel's size was increased to in 2007, and plans existed to increase this further. However, these plans were never submitted. The wheel was dismantled in 2012 to make way for 2012 Olympics celebrations and Metrolink construction work. In 2013, a new wheel was installed in Piccadilly Gardens. It was dismantled in June 2015. Puzzling World, originally a single level wooden maze at Wanaka in the Queenstown area of New Zealand, opened in 1973. It was the brainchild of Stuart and Jan Landsborough who had been forced to sell their house to raise money for the venture after being refused a bank loan. In the first year the park received 17,600 visitors. A puzzle centre was added in 1979 and a second level added to the maze 3 years later. The park continued to develop with the signature leaning tower being added in 1999 with a backwards running millennium clock face. Landsborough credits his father with instilling in him an imaginative business sense and believes that part of the reason for the park's success is because he advertises to attract adults rather than children. Resorts World Birmingham is an entertainment complex in Birmingham, England. It has the largest casino in the United Kingdom, shopping mall, restaurants and cinemas. Construction began in February 2013 and finished in autumn 2015. The Casino is owned by Genting. The tower was designed by Augustus Pugin in a neo-gothic style. When completed in 1859, it was, says horologist Ian Westworth, \"the prince of timekeepers: the biggest, most accurate four-faced striking and chiming clock in the world\". It stands 315 feet (96 m) tall, and the climb from ground level to the belfry is 334 steps. Its base is square, measuring 39 feet (12 m) on each side. Dials of the clock are 23 feet (7.0 m) in diameter. On 31 May 2009, celebrations were held to mark the tower's 150th anniversary. The Wheel of Birmingham or Birmingham Wheel was a series of transportable Ferris wheel installations at Centenary Square in Birmingham, England. These have been landmarks in central Birmingham, visible from many parts of the City. The first opened on 6 November 2003, and its replacement opened on 21 October 2004, both being tall. The attraction is located on Tooley Street, in vaults below the southern abutment of London Bridge, immediately outside London Bridge Station and originally a rival attraction, the London Dungeon, which has since moved closer to the London Eye. It is also opposite The Shard. The attraction opened on February 22, 2008 and cost in the region of £2,000,000 to develop. The Belfry is a golf resort and hotel in Wishaw, Warwickshire, close to Sutton Coldfield, England. It was acquired by KSL Capital Partners in August 2012. The structure is tall and the wheel has a diameter of . When it opened to the public in 2000 it was the world's tallest Ferris wheel. Its height was surpassed by the Star of Nanchang in 2006, the Singapore Flyer in 2008, and the High Roller (Las Vegas) in 2014. Supported by an A-frame on one side only, unlike the taller Nanchang and Singapore wheels, the Eye is described by its operators as \"the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel\". The Belfast Wheel was a tall transportable Ferris wheel installation in the centre of Belfast, Northern Ireland, in the grounds on the east side of Belfast City Hall.

            "passage:  After playing collegiate football for Georgia Tech, Anoaʻi started his professional football career with brief off-season stints with the Minnesota Vikings and Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL) in 2007. He then played a full season for the Canadian Football League's (CFL) Edmonton Eskimos in 2008 before his release and retirement from football. The 1991 WLAF season was the inaugural season of the World League of American Football and was the first transatlantic sports league. The regular season began on March 23, and concluded on May 27. The postseason ran from June 1 until June 9, when the London Monarchs defeated the Barcelona Dragons 21–0 in World Bowl '91 at Wembley Stadium in London, England. The game was a match-up of the Eastern Conference champion New York Giants (10–3–1) and the Western Conference champion Green Bay Packers (11–3). The home team Packers were a 3⅓-point favorite. Packers Ray Nitschke, Boyd Dowler, and Paul Hornung, were on leave from the U.S. Army. Hornung scored 19 points (a touchdown, three field goals, and four extra points) for the Packers and was named the MVP of the game, and awarded a 1962 Chevrolet Corvette from \"Sport\" magazine. The 1940 season was the Chicago Bears' 21st in the National Football League. The team matched on their 8–3 record from 1939 under head coach George Halas. Behind NFL greats Sid Luckman and Bronko Nagurski, the club gained a berth in the NFL Championship. There the club stormed the Washington Redskins under the brand new formation known as the T formation to claim their fourth league title. The Bears selected Clyde \"Bulldog\" Turner with their first round pick in the 1940 NFL Draft. He would be with the Bears for four Championships and be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1966. In addition to head coach Gus Dorais, the team's coaching staff included Lloyd Brazil (backfield coach, 11th year), Bud Boeringer (line coach, 15th year), and Michael H. \"Dad\" Butler (trainer, 15th year). During a ceremony at halftime on November 8, Butler, at age 71, was honored for his many years of service as the school's trainer and track and boxing coach; he was presented with $600 in cash, a radio, a \"D\" blanket, a trophy, a plaque, and scrolls. Average game attendance was 25,361. At London, Barcelona, Frankfurt and Montreal, attendances surpassed early expectations. The Monarchs' home attendance led the league, with an average of 40,481 in the regular season. The dress rehearsal for the World Bowl, London v Barcelona at Wembley in week 10, attracted 50,835 fans, while the same week Frankfurt v Sacramento received a bigger crowd, 51,653, with around 10,000 more fans turned away.

            "passage:  \"Mom and Pop Art\" was directed by Steven Dean Moore and was the first episode Al Jean wrote after his return to \"The Simpsons\" writing staff. The plot was conceived by Jean, who was inspired by a segment about found artists on the television news magazine \"60 Minutes\". The episode features contemporary artist Jasper Johns as himself, and also features Italian actress Isabella Rossellini as Astrid Weller. It references several famous artworks, such as those of Leonardo da Vinci and Henri Rousseau.  \"Medici\" is an Italian-British television drama series about the Medici dynasty set in 15th-century Florence, starring Dustin Hoffman as Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici, Richard Madden as Cosimo de' Medici, and Stuart Martin as Lorenzo de' Medici (\"The Elder\"). The series was created by Frank Spotnitz and Nicholas Meyer. Peter Freed (born June 8, 1953) is an American director and portrait photographer. His portraits of Martin Scorsese, Sandra Bullock, George Clooney, Elton John, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Robert DeNiro, and many others have appeared on the covers of the New York Times, Premier, Esquire, Architectural Digest, Newsweek, USA Today as well as movie ads and billboards. Pamela Prati (stage name of Paola Pireddu; born 26 November 1958) is an Italian actress, showgirl, model, singer, and television hostess. She has appeared in many television variety shows and in erotic comedies. She has hosted several programmes for Mediaset's Canale 5, including \"Scherzi a Parte\" and \"La sai l'ultima?\". She is also credited as Pamela Field in some of her pictures. Rochelle (played by Tichina Arnold) is Julius' strict, humorously cheeky wife and is the mother of Chris, Tonya, and Drew. She is an assertive woman who frequently becomes apprehensive over things that often have nothing to do with the current subject matter (such as Tonya becoming pregnant or her kids selling drugs). She is noted for the saucy comebacks that she uses to put a stop to any complaints that her children might have. She uses the comebacks to ensure that they do not end up performing a crime or great misdeed of some sort; she also fears that they may wind up as street criminals. The narrator describes her as a \"Ghetto Snob\", likely because of her cautious behavior towards the way her family is perceived in public. She shares loving moments with her children, showing that her true intentions for her assertive ways are sincerely because she cares for them. She also has a passion for chocolate Turtles, which often calm her, and experiences symptoms of withdrawal whenever she must sacrifice them for whatever reason. She is also noted for having to get jobs, and then quitting her job whenever she has a problem with it. Rochelle's famous catchphrase that refers to this running gag is: \"I don't need this, my man has two jobs!\" This expresses her using Julius' having two jobs as an excuse to quit her job and be comfortable at home. She is very judgemental towards Julius when it comes to their marriage. This can be seen in the episodes where she starts to think that Julius will leave her for a white woman or finds something which leads her to believe that Julius is having an affair. She sometimes disagrees to Julius' methods about being cheap, like when they celebrated Kwanza instead of Christmas. Julius believes that this method is an effective way to save money for more important things rather than materialistic items. There are times where Rochelle understands Julius' behavior, like in the episode where he got a second job in order to earn more money for the family. However, Rochelle eventually developed second thoughts about the situation, for she believed that Julius was actually throwing money away. In the final season of the series, Rochelle works as a beautician at Nessa's Beauty Salon, where in previous seasons she would often get her hair done. She also shared gossip with her friend and owner of the salon, Vanessa (Jackee Harry) and other workers of the salon. Another running gag about her is that she regularly threatens her children with physical violence but does not hit them. It is only when she takes them into a room saying \"we need to talk\" when she smacks them.

            "passage:  The Funerary monument for an athlete is an Ancient Greek relief that depicts a young nude male holding two pomegranates over his head in his left hand, and an aryballos (a flask for perfume and oils) in the other. He stands facing right in profile to the viewer, with one foot stepping out in front of the other. The relief is 98 x 24 3/4 x 9 3/4 inches and is carved in marble. Crematorio is the story of the Bertomeus, a family that has managed to amass a great fortune over several generations. Rubén Bertomeu left agricultural businesses behind to create a business network that has made him the richest and most powerful man in Misent. Only in the family environment Rubén Bertomeu finds opposition to his way of understanding progress. The story's setting is based on the 6th century Mediterranean world, and the looming conflict between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Ostrogothic kingdom of Italy that had replaced the Western Roman Empire. Varena, the capital of Batiara, alludes to Ravenna, the Ostrogothic capital, while Sarantium, the capital of Trakesia, is inspired by Byzantium or Constantinople. The novels \"The Lions of Al-Rassan\", \"The Last Light of the Sun\", and \"A Brightness Long Ago\" also take place in that unnamed world, although in different settings. In the series the audience is also briefly acquainted with the character Ashar ibn Ashar, who is the creator of the Asharite religion seen in \"The Lions of Al-Rassan\". The seeds of change for the great empire based in Sarantium are thus already being sown even at the height of its power and prestige. Set in Alexandria, the novel tells the story of Chrysis, a courtesan, and the sculptor Démétrios. A Galilaean with long golden hair (source of her Greek nickname), Chrysis is proud of her beauty and her skill at winning the devotion and servility of men. Démétrios, for his part, is worshipped by the women of the town, but has grown tired of their devotion. He has come to prefer his statue of the goddess Aphrodite even to his lover, Queen Bérénice, who posed for it. Chrysis is the only woman who does not care for him. Piqued into desire by her resistance, Démétrios is spurred to commit theft and murder for her, to win the three objects she demands in return for her charms: a rival courtesan's silver mirror, the ivory comb of an Egyptian priestess, and the pearl necklace that adorns the cult image in the temple of Aphrodite. After carrying out these errands, Démétrios dreams of the night of love that Chrysis has offered him and while she falls in love with the man who was moved to crime for her, Démétrios rejects the real Chrysis, sufficed by his dream. She presses her desire, so he makes her swear, as he had, to do his bidding, before revealing what it is: to wear the stolen items in public. She does so, appearing on the Lighthouse of Alexandria in the role of Aphrodite, nude and with the items worn as the attributes of the goddess. Imprisoned and condemned, Chrysis drinks hemlock in the indifferent presence of Démétrios. He then uses her nude body as a model, posing it in the violent attitude in which he had seen her in his dream, to create the statue of Immortal Life. The Hefaiston is an annual gathering and international competition of blacksmiths that is held at the Helfštýn castle, Czech Republic. It is named after the Greek god Hephaestus. The event is organized by the Comenius Museum in Přerov in collaboration with the administration of the castle since 1982. The 29th gathering (held in 2010) was attended by more than four hundred blacksmiths. The Hefaiston is considered one of the most important annual meetings of artist blacksmiths in the world. According to Roman tradition, the Law of the Twelve Tables (Latin: Leges Duodecim Tabularum or Duodecim Tabulae) was the legislation that stood at the foundation of Roman law. The Tables consolidated earlier traditions into an enduring set of laws. Its title refers to the surrealist game, Cadavre Exquis, invented by André Breton, in which the participants draw consecutive sections of a figure without seeing what the previous person has drawn, leading to unpredictable results, and is meant to describe the meandering nature of the film with its unpredictable foray into the world of political manipulations, as well as the (\"illustrous\") corpses of the murdered judges. Assirati began weight-training at the age of twelve. At the age of seventeen, Assirati formed part of the acrobatic stage duo Mello and Nello. Travelling to every port they could reach, the pair performed a variety of hand-balancing acts. At the age of twenty, Assirati began his career as a professional wrestler, but continued to train as a weight-lifter. At his highest weight, he was one of the strongest men in the world, and could still perform such acrobatic maneuvres as the iron cross and a one-arm hand stand. After winning matches, Assirati would perform a standing back flip. In 1938, Assirati deadlifted 800 pounds. He trained for his career in wrestling under Atholl Oakeley. Upset that his youthful sweetheart Darla has once again thrown him over in favor of neighborhood bully Butch, Alfalfa tries to forget his troubles by watching a sidewalk performance by famed hypnotist Professor William Delmore. Chosen as a subject, Alfalfa is hypnotized into believing that he is the fearless D'Artagnan, of Three Musketeers fame. Armed with this bold new personality, Alfalfa not only sweeps Darla off her feet, but also challenges the dumbfounded Butch to a duel. The results, while not deadly, are devastating. The parable stems from the classical era of ancient Greece and is reported by Xenophon in \"Memorabilia\" 2.1.21–34. In Xenophon's text, Socrates tells how the young Heracles, as the hero contemplates his future, is visited by the female personifications of Vice and Virtue (Ancient Greek: Κακία and Ἀρετή; \"Kakía\" and \"Areté\"). They offer him a choice between a pleasant and easy life or a severe but glorious life, and present their respective arguments. Xenophon credits the invention of the parable to Prodicus. He cites a precursor in Hesiod's \"Works and Days\", which also contrasts the paths of vice and virtue. \n",

Aleksei Mikhailovich Chaly (; born 13 June 1961) is a businessman and formerly \"de facto\" mayor of Sevastopol. He declared himself mayor in February 2014, amidst the Crimean crisis, after the resignation of Volodymyr Yatsuba, the Viktor Yanukovych-appointed mayor. With Chaly as mayor, Sevastopol participated in the March 2014 referendum in which Crimea voted to separate itself politically from Ukraine and accede to Russia. On 1 April 2014 he was appointed as Governor of Sevastopol City by Russia. On 14 April, he was replaced by Sergey Menyaylo. Donskoy is an entrepreneur, with interests in the supermarket, according to at least to one source. He was elected as mayor of Arhangelsk in March 2005, reportedly the youngest mayor of the city to date. His announcement on November 1, 2006 of the intention to run for the presidency of Russia was followed and allegedly anticipated by official pressure. He became the subject of a criminal investigation toward the end of 2006 and, in early 2007, was accused of abuse of office and of forging a university diploma. Following his subsequent arrest, he was released, but was arrested for the second time in July 2007. As of early October, Donskoy remained in pre-trial detention, with the third of three cases awaiting hearing. At least two sources reported that Donskoy had been handed a suspended sentence (of one year) for charges related to \"faking documents\" and \"illegal business activity.\" It is not clear whether this result constituted sentences associated with two prosecuted cases or one. Prosecutors are seeking restrictions on future political activity as part of the judgment following the third trial. Supporters maintain his innocence and propose political causes for his continued prosecution.

This was the first election to not feature either of the two previous holders of the office, Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson, who had run against each other in 2008 and 2012. Johnson, as incumbent mayor, had chosen not to stand for re-election for a third term in office, having been elected as the Conservative Party MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the 2015 general election. The campaign was dominated by the personal battle between Goldsmith and Khan, and their contrasting class and ethnic backgrounds. Through his victory, Khan became the second Labour Party Mayor of London after Livingstone, and the first Muslim mayor of a European Union capital city. \n",

On 10 November 2018 several ticket-selling websites, such as Ticketmaster and See Tickets, crashed due to the overwhelming volume of people attempting to buy tickets. Ticketmaster later stated that at one point, over 700,000 fans were simultaneously attempting to purchase tickets making it their busiest sale ever. The six original dates sold out within minutes, prompting the group to add additional dates in Manchester and London. More dates were soon announced to take place in Coventry and Cardiff due to further demand. On 16 November, a show in Dublin's Croke Park was announced, the band’s first in Ireland in 21 years. Consequently, the tour was renamed to Spice World – 2019 Tour. \n",

The Eiffel Tower has appeared frequently in works of fiction because of its iconic nature. Movie critic Roger Ebert has noted in his online column that no matter where in Paris a film scene is set the Eiffel Tower will be visible in the background. It is located on the fourth floor of the Akihabara UDX building, near JR Akihabara Station. The tower is painted in three shades: lighter at the top, getting progressively darker towards the bottom to complement the Parisian sky. It was originally reddish brown; this changed in 1968 to a bronze colour known as \"Eiffel Tower Brown\".

Constantly mocking their sister's employment at a local massage parlour, they spend most of their time joking around, taking drugs and stealing cars. The story is set in the Rhondda Valley in the early 1930s. It chronicles the trials and tribulations of the peoples, set against the backdrop of the aftermath of the General Strike and the Great Depression in the South Wales Valleys. It is principally seen through the eyes of a newly ordained chapel minister, the Reverend Dan Price. Near Cheshire's Golden Triangle, and on the Cheshire Plain between the Peak District to the east and the Welsh mountains to the west, Knutsford and its surrounding villages are affluent and sought-after residential areas, with properties rated as some of the most expensive outside of London. Knutsford is a dormitory town for people working in Manchester and Liverpool.

It features the staff of English Mobile Mechanics in Marbella, Spain, following the activities of the garage and initially it followed new staff hires as they adjusted to life in Spain whilst coping with their new jobs and their boss, Jock Campbell. As work in southern Spain depends on tourists or villa owners that winter elsewhere the Garage's trade is highly seasonal. Four out of the five new recruits found themselves with insufficient paid work (no customer jobs to book time to) so eventually announced that they were leaving and vacated their positions.

In October 2006, the series was cancelled after nine years, despite viewing figures of well over 7 million. Taylor took the leading role of Laura Fitzgerald, the Deputy Mayor of Flatby, a town on the East Coast of England. As the series begins, she is informed that because Flatby was never surveyed for the Domesday Book, it has never officially been annexed into the United Kingdom. As a result, and much to the chagrin of the Government in London, Laura rallies the townsfolk to declare Flatby an independent state.

This was the first election to not feature either of the two previous holders of the office, Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson, who had run against each other in 2008 and 2012. Johnson, as incumbent mayor, had chosen not to stand for re-election for a third term in office, having been elected as the Conservative Party MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the 2015 general election. The campaign was dominated by the personal battle between Goldsmith and Khan, and their contrasting class and ethnic backgrounds.

The \"prison\", at a secret location near Potters Bar, Hertfordshire (Actual location was near Colsdale farm, just outside Cuffley), was fitted with hi-tech security systems. \"Inmates\" faced a three-week authentic prison regime, complete with 35 prison guards and a high fence topped with razor wire. A number of flaws in the security system were deliberately placed by the production team. Escapes were aided by a series of clues (often revealing flaws in the security system through cryptic messages), and by texts from the viewing public with suggestions on escape routes.

Two series plus a Christmas special have aired on BBC 3, in total 12 episodes, beginning in 2013 and concluding in 2014. First aired on the ITV Network in 2005, this £1 million programme centres on a reconstruction of the Houses of Parliament as they were in 1605 (the current ones had not yet been built at the time of the Gunpowder Plot), constructed using period equivalent methods wherever possible. This was stocked with mannequins to represent notable commoners, members and the king before the bomb was detonated. The programme was made to coincide with the 400th anniversary of the plot. The main contractor was Murray and Stewart (Pty) Ltd. Consulting engineers KFD Wilkinson and Partners were local agents for Studio Nervi. Depropping of the entire structure was carried out during December 1976. Murray and Stewart published a postcard showing 18 tower cranes at their sites in Cape Town that year.

The Wheel of Birmingham or Birmingham Wheel was a series of transportable Ferris wheel installations at Centenary Square in Birmingham, England. These have been landmarks in central Birmingham, visible from many parts of the City. The first opened on 6 November 2003, and its replacement opened on 21 October 2004, both being tall. The tower was designed by Augustus Pugin in a neo-gothic style. When completed in 1859, it was, says horologist Ian Westworth, \"the prince of timekeepers: the biggest, most accurate four-faced striking and chiming clock in the world\". It stands 315 feet (96 m) tall, and the climb from ground level to the belfry is 334 steps. Its base is square, measuring 39 feet (12 m) on each side. Dials of the clock are 23 feet (7.0 m) in diameter. On 31 May 2009, celebrations were held to mark the tower's 150th anniversary.

Winehouse died at her nearby Camden Square home of alcohol poisoning on 23 July 2011. The tall statue depicts Winehouse with her hand on her hip, wearing high heels, and with her signature beehive hairstyle. The singer's statue also wears a Star of David necklace and on the day of the unveiling had a real red rose in her hair. The charcoal grey work was created by the British sculptor Scott Eaton, who said that it had been designed to convey Winehouse's \"attitude and strength, but also give subtle hints of insecurity\".  In 2004, Lewisham council sold one of three adjacent public housing tower blocks on the economically deprived Pepys Estate to a private property developer. The tower was converted into luxury apartments and sold to people who, for the most part, did not grow up in the local area. The documentary was filmed over three years and chronicled the difficulties faced by some of the local residents in adapting to the changes sweeping the neighbourhood. Notable characters included heroin-addicted Leol and his alcoholic best friend Nicky, and the landlord of the local pub who is struggling with the challenges of satisfying his conservative (and dwindling) 'old guard' and tempting the new arrivals - mostly young and relatively wealthy - into his traditional boozer. \n",

The stadium was named by chairman Bob Murray to reflect the coal mining heritage of the North East and the former Monkwearmouth Colliery site on which it stands. A Davy lamp monument stands at the entrance to reflect the coal mining industry that brought prosperity to the town. In May 2018, it was announced that the Southern family had purchased a team in the nascent Canadian Premier League and would begin retro-fitting a portion of Spruce Meadows to construct a stadium for that purpose. By July of that year, construction of the venue commenced at the \"Meadows on the Green\" facility, including the construction of a 4,500-seat covered grandstand on the east side and 1,500 seats combined on the north and south ends. The stadium utilizes a modular design which can be easily expanded with demand in the future and was privately funded. The team predicted that the stadium experience would be, \"one of the most unique professional soccer experiences in Canada—if not the world.\" MetLife Stadium is an American sports stadium located at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, west of New York City. It is the home stadium of two National Football League (NFL) franchises, the New York Giants and the New York Jets, as well as the New York Guardians of the XFL. Originally known as New Meadowlands Stadium upon opening in 2010, its naming rights were acquired in 2011 by New York City-based insurance company MetLife. The stadium is owned by the MetLife Stadium Company, a joint venture of the Giants and Jets, which two teams privately financed the construction of the venue on land belonging to the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. At an approximate cost of $1.6 billion, it was the most expensive stadium ever built at the time that it opened.

            "passage:  The structure consists of six parasols in the form of giant mushrooms (\"Las setas\" in Spanish), whose design is inspired by the vaults of the Cathedral of Seville and the ficus trees in the nearby Plaza de Cristo de Burgos. Metropol Parasol is organized in four levels. The underground level (Level 0) houses the \"Antiquarium\", where Roman and Moorish remains discovered on site are displayed in a museum. Level 1 (street level) is the Central Market. The roof of Level 1 is the surface of the open-air public plaza, shaded by the wooden parasols above and designed for public events. Levels 2 and 3 are the two stages of the panoramic terraces (including a restaurant), offering one of the best views of the city centre. The hotel opened in January 2006 as the Hesperia Tower. It was renamed NH Collection Barcelona Tower in 2016. It was again renamed Hesperia Barcelona Tower Hotel in early 2019. It is set to be renamed Hyatt Regency Barcelona Fira in late 2019, following a major renovation. The building with its 116-meter height and 23 floors is the twelfth-tallest in the Spanish capital (counting the CTBA towers). It was the headquarters of the Rumasa company, during which time its name was changed to Torres de Jerez (Towers of Jerez), in honour of the home town of the company. It is currently valued at $116 million.  Société Générale Twin Towers are two office skyscrapers located in La Défense, a high-rise business district, and in Nanterre, France, west of Paris. Their exterior designs are identical. In addition to serving as home of the Pioneros and as a shelter for natural disasters, the Polifórum is also used for concerts, other sporting events, and other special events. It is also unusual in that its center-hung scoreboard does not include video screens, a must for most new arenas in the 21st century. There are 2,200 permanent seats. The arena cost 98 million pesos to build. It houses the five-star hotel \"Eurostars Madrid Tower,\" which occupies 60% of the tower, with rooms between floors 6 and 27 and at its upper part, a two-storey dining room offering a panoramic view of the city. The professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) moved its offices in the capital (about 2500 professionals) to this building in July 2011, taking up seventeen floors, between floors 34 and 50, which were vacant at that time. On the same date, the PwC logo was mounted at the top of the building, becoming the highest logo in Spain, installed at almost 236 meters of height. With the relocation of the offices of PwC to the tower, the building was renamed Torre PwC instead of Torre Sacyr Vallehermoso. All the office floors have the same area of and are divided into three sectors or segments. Floors 51-58 are intended for general facilities and equipment of the tower. It is used at the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts (O'Keefe Centre) in Toronto, and a number of sport stadiums, for instance at the Emirates Stadium of the Arsenal Football Club (439 displays), or the American Airlines Arena of the Miami Heat, and some cinemas like those from the Vue network.  Metropol Parasol is a wooden structure located at \"La Encarnación\" square, in the old quarter of Seville, Spain. It was designed by the German architect Jürgen Mayer and completed in April 2011. It has dimensions of 150 by 70 metres (490 by 230 ft) and an approximate height of and claims to be the largest wooden structure in the world. Its appearance, location, delays and cost overruns in construction resulted in much public controversy. The building is popularly known as Las Setas de la Encarnación (Incarnation's mushrooms). The Paris Métro (; ), short for Métropolitain, is a rapid transit system in the Paris metropolitan area, France. A symbol of the city, it is known for its density within the city limits, uniform architecture and unique entrances influenced by Art Nouveau. It is mostly underground and long. It has 302 stations, of which 62 have transfers between lines. There are 16 lines (with an additional four under construction), numbered 1 to 14 with two lines, 3bis and 7bis, which are named because they started out as branches of Line 3 and Line 7; later they officially became separate lines.

            "passage:  Location plate shooting took place in Chicago in April 2007. Several chase scenes, including one with a low flying helicopter, were shot in Chicago over two days, on Wacker Drive along the Chicago River, between Columbus Drive and LaSalle Street.The opening scene was filmed using the Carbide & Carbon Building.Production moved to the Czech Republic later in May, scheduled for 12 weeks of shooting, which included a scene in Pernštejn Castle. Using a former sugar factory in Prague, production designer John Myhre constructed a large textile factory as part of an industrial world, the setting of a mythological environment in which looms create fabrics that weavers interpret as assassination orders. Afterward, filming moved to Budapest, then returned to Chicago in August. While the actors performed many of their own stunts, with free running and parkour in some of the action scenes, and Angelina Jolie being actually strapped to the hood of a moving Dodge Viper, some of the especially high-risk sequences required digital doubles instead. Two full-sized train cars were built, a Chicago 'L' for a training scene where Fox and Wesley run atop a train, and a Czech Pendolino for the derailment, which was stationed in a gimbal equipped with hydraulics to allow the car to tilt and roll as the train crashed. The film originally had both an alternate opening and an alternate ending. The alternate opening, a flashback to ancient times describing the history of the Fraternity and the Loom of Fate, is available on the special edition DVD and Blu-ray. The plot follows an ailing theater director (Hoffman) as he works on an increasingly elaborate stage production whose extreme commitment to realism begins to blur the boundaries between fiction and reality. The film's title is a play on Schenectady, New York, where much of the film is set, and the concept of synecdoche, wherein a part of something represents the whole, or vice versa. The film follows the filmmakers as they travel through eastern Slovakia to interview Warhol's surviving relatives, ethnic-Rusyns living near the Polish border in Miková, and to visit the Andy Warhol Museum of Modern Art in Medzilaborce. The museum is shown to be in a poor state, with the museum director and staff openly soliciting donations from the viewer and giving out the museum's bank account details. The film opens in a future Paris with scenes establishing the kidnapping of 22-year-old scientist Ilona Tasuiev, who works for the megacorporation Avalon. The focus transitions to police captain Barthélémy Karas, as he defuses a hostage situation by killing the hostage-takers. Afterwards Karas is given the job of solving the mystery surrounding Ilona's disappearance. Karas begins by contacting Dr. Jonas Muller, a former Avalon scientist familiar with her. Wajda presents a shocking image of the city, with its dirty and dangerous factories and ostentatiously opulent residences devoid of taste and culture. The film follows in the footsteps of Charles Dickens, Émile Zola and Maxim Gorky, as well as German expressionists such as Knopf, Meidner and Grosz, who gave testimony of social protest. The film's plot centers on famous American director Nicholas Ray's 1960s stay in SFR Yugoslavia upon the invitation of Ratko Dražević, the head of Avala Film studio and former Yugoslav state security operative. It is loosely based on actual events. Since, according to Tucaković, the story of Ray's Belgrade stay is \"quite foggy\", the film's characters were treated \"more as a myth than as a document\". Additionally, since Dražević's specific biographical info is entirely sketchy and mostly based on anecdotes, actor who plays him in the movie, Dragan Bjelogrlić, said that his portrayal is \"based on legend rather than biography\". The beginning of the film contains some animations depicting Abram's acquisition from his native land and eventually we find him in the courts of Paris. He gets himself in trouble when a French countess, whom he had romances with, bears a black child. Abram is challenged to a duel which is played out humorously in a sped up timeframe. He leaves Paris shortly thereafter to return to his home in St. Petersburg where his godfather, and czar of Russia Peter the Great enthusiastically awaits his return. Upon arriving Abram expresses he is done with love, as his lover denounces him as a savage and his son is never fated to know his father. In an attempt to help Abram, as well as tie him into the nobility of Russia, Peter announces Abram and Natasha Rtishcheva are to be wed, to the despair of the family and her current suitor. Abram, however, refuses the marriage on the grounds that he believes Natasha is in love with another. This angers the czar who in turn begins to alienate both Abram and Natasha's family from his favor. The conundrum plays out in humorous and dramatic ways and eventually resolves in a pleasant and light-hearted manner. The Shop on Main Street (Czech/Slovak: Obchod na korze; in the UK The Shop on the High Street) is a 1965 Czechoslovak film about the Aryanization programme during World War II in the Slovak State. Cinevilla is now a major tourist attraction, and is the only such large-scale open-air cinema exhibition in the Baltic States. In 2008, Jānis Streičs shot the film \"Rudolf's Gold\" on the lot, simulating a Kurzeme farmstead.

The Browns and the Giants are the only NFL teams that have never had cheerleaders, while the other aforementioned teams have had cheer squads in the past. However, there are reports that the Browns did have cheerleaders in 1971, but no records exist. The Chicago Bears season was the franchise's 88th season in the National Football League. The season officially began on September 9, 2007 against the San Diego Chargers, and concluded on December 30 against the New Orleans Saints. The Bears entered the 2007 season as the National Football Conference Champions and had hopes of returning to the Super Bowl, but instead finished the season with a disappointing 7–9 record, and missing the playoffs for the first time since 2004. The Dallas Cowboys season was the franchise's 56th season in the National Football League, the seventh playing their home games at AT&T Stadium and the fifth full season under head coach Jason Garrett. The team finished the regular season at 4–12. It was the team's worst record since 1989, in Jerry Jones' first year as owner when they went 1–15. Their collapse from a 2-0 start was because of key injuries to their starters through the remaining 15 weeks and they were eliminated from playoff contention after losing to the Jets in Week 15. The 2007 season was the Dallas Cowboys' 48th in the National Football League (NFL), their 19th under the ownership of Jerry Jones, their 36th playing their home games at Texas Stadium, their first season under offensive coordinator Jason Garrett and their first season under head coach Wade Phillips.  Spygate was an incident during the National Football League (NFL)'s 2007 season, when the New England Patriots were disciplined by the league for videotaping New York Jets' defensive coaches' signals from an unauthorized location during a September 9, 2007 game. Videotaping opposing coaches is not illegal in the NFL de jure, but there are designated areas allowed by the league to do such taping. Because the Patriots were instead videotaping the Jets' coaches from their own sideline during the game, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell deemed it to be in violation of league rules, stating that the act represented a calculated and deliberate attempt to avoid long-standing rules designed to encourage fair play and promote honest competition on the playing field. After an investigation, the NFL fined Patriots head coach Bill Belichick $500,000 (the maximum allowed by the league and the largest fine ever imposed on a coach in the league's 87-year history) for his role in the incident, fined the Patriots $250,000, and docked the team their original first-round selection in the 2008 NFL Draft which would have been the 31st pick of the draft. The fine garnered significant media attention for being the \"maximum amount\" an individual could be fined. The 2017 Dallas Cowboys season was the franchise's 58th season in the National Football League, the ninth playing their home games at AT&T Stadium and the seventh full season under head coach Jason Garrett. It was also the 29th season under owner Jerry Jones. The 2007 Pro Bowl was the National Football League's all-star game for the 2006 season. The game took place on February 10, 2007, at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii. The game was held on a Saturday instead of the usual Sunday after the Super Bowl because of a request by broadcaster CBS. \n",

Since 2019, the group has been re-branded to the \"Seahawks Dancers\", and now includes male cheerleaders/stuntmen. They are now along with the Baltimore Ravens Cheerleaders as a permanent co-ed squad. The Seahawks along with the Indianapolis Colts, Philadelphia Eagles, New Orleans Saints, Los Angeles Rams, Tennessee Titans, and New England Patriots are the only ones with males on their squads. The old name \"Team Euphoria\" was used at Lingerie Bowl I, broadcast during Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004. They were beaten by Team Dream by a score of 6-0. As of 2016, six teams do not have cheerleading squads: Buffalo Bills, Chicago Bears, Cleveland Browns, Green Bay Packers, New York Giants, and the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Packers do, however, use a collegiate squad to cheer at home games. Super Bowl XLV between the Steelers and the Packers in February 2011 was the first time a Super Bowl featured no cheerleaders.

Three games were canceled as the result of unsafe playing fields: a 1995 NFL preseason game between the San Diego Chargers and the Houston Oilers, a 2001 preseason game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Philadelphia Eagles, and the 2016 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. An additional preseason game, the 2017 Texas Governor's Cup, was cancelled for weather. At least one other announced game was discarded before it was officially placed on the schedule. The proposed China Bowl exhibition was to have been played in August 2007 but was postponed indefinitely before the 2007 schedule was released, with all plans for the game formally canceled before December 2008.

While initially approved to launch the franchise in 2007, Prochnow's group's plans were accelerated to 2006 when Hurricane Katrina prevented the New Orleans VooDoo from playing during the 2006 AFL season. At the end of the 2006 season, Prochnow sold his stake in the team to local businessman Chris Likens who took over operations.

Greeted upon entering office with mass civil rights demonstrations, Grabarek was credited with striking a tone of moderation. He established the \"Durham Interim Committee,\" composed of two black and nine white members, with a mandate to “resolve and reconcile” racial differences. Over the next few months, segregation ended at most of Durham's restaurants, hotels and movie theaters, swimming pools, libraries, the chamber of commerce, and the Jaycees.

Johnson, as incumbent mayor, had chosen not to stand for re-election for a third term in office, having been elected as the Conservative Party MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the 2015 general election. The campaign was dominated by the personal battle between Goldsmith and Khan, and their contrasting class and ethnic backgrounds. Through his victory, Khan became the second Labour Party Mayor of London after Livingstone, and the first Muslim mayor of a European Union capital city.

During the century prior to the First Opium War of 1839, trade relations between China and Europe were exclusively conducted via the \"Cohong\", which was formalised by imperial edict in 1760 by the Qianlong Emperor. The Chinese merchants who made up the \"Cohong\" were referred to as \"hangshang\" (行商) and their foreign counterparts as \"yanghang\" (t, literally \"foreign traders\").

The novel starts with Melanie stealing her mother's wedding dress and venturing out in the night into her family's property. However, on her way home, she realises she forgot the door key and is forced to climb up a tree to get back into her room, destroying the dress in the process. The next morning, Melanie learns of the unexpected deaths of her parents in a plane crash over the Grand Canyon, and she and her two siblings – Victoria and Jonathon – are moved to South London, to the care of her tyrannical uncle Philip, a bullish and eccentric maker of life-sized puppets and fantastical old fashioned toys. There, she meets her mute aunt Margaret, who is mistreated by and terrified of her husband and only converses through notes. She also meets Margaret's younger brothers Francie, a fiddler, and the rakish Finn. At first, Uncle Philip ignores Melanie and her siblings as they are introduced to his bizarre puppet shows and she is made to work selling toys in the toyshop. Meanwhile, Finn and Melanie grow closer until he takes her to a park which is the ruins of the National Exhibition of 1852. There, after seeing a worn, fallen statue of Queen Victoria and walking across a chess board (only on the white squares), Finn kisses Melanie. She feels intruded on by the gesture, imagining it to be romantic only as an observer from far away. The kiss begins Melanie's conflicted feelings of attraction toward Finn. Emelan is a fictional realm that provides the main setting of the Circle of Magic quartet by Tamora Pierce, primarily in the capital city of Summersea and the nearby temple of Winding Circle. Of the follow-up books, only Magic Steps of the quartet The Circle Opens and the opening sequence of the standalone book The Will of the Empress take place in Emelan. Ugla, an unrefined girl from the countryside, moves from an outlying area of Northern Iceland to the capital city of Reykjavík in order to work for Búi Árland, a member of parliament, and to learn how to play the organ. She’s met with a world that’s completely foreign to her: politicians and the military move freely about the city, and she views city residents as spoiled, snobbish and arrogant. In contrast, she comes from a rural area where the Icelandic Sagas of the Middle Ages constitute the majority of what people discuss and ponder and are viewed as more important than reality. These historical backgrounds are certainly important and provide crucial patterns. The prime minister subsequently carries out secret dealings with the Americans and “sells” the country. Ugla, however, also confronts other current issues, above all in the organ player’s house. There, she comes in contact with communist and anarchist mindsets and likewise protests the construction of an atom station in Iceland. After a short relationship with Búi Árland, Ugla decides to return to the “selfconscious policeman”, who is the father of her recently born child.

Despite losing to England in the last match of the series, Australia successfully defended their title, eclipsing the English side on goal difference. In the third match of the series, England's Jenny Gunn became the first player, male or female, to play in 100 Twenty20 International matches. In the fifth match, Australia's Meg Lanning became the first player for Australia, male or female, to score 2,000 runs in Twenty20 Internationals. Waking from their latest jump, Ryan Cawdor and his friends find themselves in a MAT-TRANS chamber which is smaller than the norm. This curious change is overshadowed by their next discovery: the chamber door release latch is stuck, leaving the group no way to leave the chamber and no way to start another MAT-TRANS jump to a different redoubt. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to make the mechanism work, Krysty Wroth calls upon her mutant strength and forces the door open. This frees the group but breaks the latch mechanism completely, rendering the MAT-TRANS inoperable. Rick Ginsberg, a cryonic patient from 2001 who was \"thawed\" by Ryan, estimates that he can fix the mechanism, but will need at least basic tools to do so. Only 11 men's teams and 5 women's teams entered the Championships. Hungary, the United States and Austria were the major nations missing. Viktor Barna and Richard Bergmann played under the England flag for the first time. Magical enforcers Ziggy and Victor Battiato, inform Nate, Summer, Trevor, and Pigeon of the disappearances of fellow enforcer John Dart and magician Mozag and direct the group to investigate the Arcadeland arcade. After visiting the arcade, the friends resolve to earn enough tickets to obtain the magical hand stamps, which grant membership into four exclusive clubs. Nate receives his stamp from the owner of Arcadeland, magician Jonas White, who reveals that he is using the clubs to hunt for a powerful artifact named Uweya. Lindy Stott, who is unaware that she is actually Jonas' sister, Belinda White, also earns a stamp, to the dismay of her adoptive guardian Sebastian Stott. Summer gets a Tank stamp, which grants increased endurance, Pigeon joins the Subs, allowing him to breathe underwater, Trevor becomes a Racer, allowing him to move at inhuman speed, and Nate and Lindy join the Jets, who can fly. To ensure their obedience, Jonas creates a simulacrum, a voodoo doll-like facsimile, of each club member. The 2017 ICC Champions Trophy was the eighth ICC Champions Trophy, a cricket tournament for the eight top-ranked One Day International (ODI) teams in the world.

On September 15, 2006, 10 of the Nobel Laureates launched the PeaceJam Foundation's Global Call to Action with the youth of the world as a part of PeaceJam's 10th Anniversary Celebration. The first WE Day was held in October 2007 at the Ricoh Coliseum in Toronto, Canada. Since then, the program has expanded to include annual events in 17 cities in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, including Vancouver, London, Chicago and Seattle. The event has featured speeches by global leaders such as Al Gore, Elie Wiesel, Martin Luther King III, Kofi Annan and performances by artists such as Demi Lovato, Selena Gomez, Lilly Singh, Jennifer Hudson and Nelly Furtado. This was the first election to not feature either of the two previous holders of the office, Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson, who had run against each other in 2008 and 2012. Johnson, as incumbent mayor, had chosen not to stand for re-election for a third term in office, having been elected as the Conservative Party MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the 2015 general election. The campaign was dominated by the personal battle between Goldsmith and Khan, and their contrasting class and ethnic backgrounds. Through his victory, Khan became the second Labour Party Mayor of London after Livingstone, and the first Muslim mayor of a European Union capital city. \n",

            "passage:  Prior to the tournament, Bangladesh's captain Mashrafe Mortaza was suspended for one match for maintaining a slow over-rate in the third ODI between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in April 2017. Shakib Al Hasan captained Bangladesh for the first match. The matches took place at two of the grounds to be used for the main tournament (Edgbaston and The Oval) between 26–30 May 2017. The tournament was initially scheduled to take place in Bangladesh, but in May 2017 it was reported that the event would instead be hosted elsewhere as Bangladesh were close to automatic qualification, and thus would not need to participate in this tournament. Three bids were under consideration: one from Zimbabwe, one from the United Arab Emirates and a joint-bid from Ireland and Scotland, who were the winners of the previous qualifier tournament. The development which has been granted planning permission by North Tipperary County Council would include a 500 room five star hotel, casino, a replica of the White House, and the venue's racecourse will include a national hunt track, a 7-furlong sprint track and an all-weather flood-lit track. This would be combined with a greyhound track, a dual stadium incorporating a capacity for 7,000 patrons, a racecourse featuring a National Hunt Track, sprint track and all-weather floodlit track and a 15,000-seater underground entertainment venue with a retractable roof.  Ireland (Irish: Éire [ˈeːɾʲə] ( listen)), also known as the Republic of Ireland (Poblacht na hÉireann), is a country in north-western Europe occupying 26 of 32 counties of the island of Ireland. The capital and largest city is Dublin, which is located on the eastern part of the island, and whose metropolitan area is home to around a third of the country's 4.8 million inhabitants. The sovereign state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom. It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, Saint George's Channel to the south-east, and the Irish Sea to the east. It is a unitary, parliamentary republic. The legislature, the Oireachtas, consists of a lower house, Dáil Éireann, an upper house, Seanad Éireann, and an elected President (Uachtarán) who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state, but with some important powers and duties. The head of government is the Taoiseach (Prime Minister, literally 'Chief', a title not used in English), who is elected by the Dáil and appointed by the President; the Taoiseach in turn appoints other government ministers. \"All the Stations\" was crowdfunded via Kickstarter, raising a total of £38,654 in 40 days (from 15 February to 27 March 2017) for the Great Britain season in 2017, and £26,350 for the Ireland season in 2019. Every contributor who donated £10 or more to the Kickstarter campaign was able to adopt a station, and their name appeared on the map on the project's website. \"Ballinafad House\", is situated in Belcara, outside Castlebar, County Mayo, it featured on \"The Great House Revival\", presented by Hugh Wallace on RTE, 2018. The 2018 Electric Ireland Fitzgibbon Cup was the 102nd staging of the Fitzgibbon Cup since its establishment in 1912. In the final on 24 February, the University of Limerick defeated DCU by 2-21 to 2-15.  Denmark won 5–1 on aggregate and qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The Ireland cricket team toured India in February and March 2019 to play three Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is), five One Day Internationals (ODIs) and a Test match against the Afghanistan cricket team. It was Ireland's first Test played overseas and the first Test match between the two sides. All of the fixtures took place at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in Dehradun. The ODI fixtures were part of Afghanistan's preparation for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. In January 2019, the fixtures were brought forward by two days, to avoid clashing with the Indian Premier League. \n",

The trophy was designed by artist Manuel Ferrari and is handmade out of steel by the metalworker Kaspar Swankey. Fiorello Henry La Guardia (; born Fiorello Enrico La Guardia, ; December 11, 1882September 20, 1947) was an American politician. He is best known for being the 99th Mayor of New York City for three terms from 1934 to 1945 as a pro-New Deal liberal progressive Republican. Previously he had been elected to Congress in 1916 and 1918, and again from 1922 through 1930. Irascible, energetic, and charismatic, he craved publicity and is acclaimed as one of the greatest mayors in American history. Only five feet, two inches (1.57 m) tall, he was called \"the Little Flower\" (\"\" is Italian for \"little flower\"). Darwin Alexander Hindman (April 30, 1933 – June 17, 2019) was an American politician and mayor of Columbia, Missouri. He was elected mayor in 1995 and finished his fifth elected term (15 years total) in April 2010 after announcing he would not be running for re-election at the end of that term. During Hindman's term as mayor, Columbia and three other cities received 25 million dollars in federal funding to run a pilot project to promote bicycling and walking as an alternative to driving. In 2009 he was one of three mayors to receive the Leadership for Healthy Communities Award, along with Michael Bloomberg of New York City and Gavin Newsom of San Francisco. He has been called the \"Father of the Katy Trail.\" He was one of the longest serving members of the Columbia City Council. This was the first election to not feature either of the two previous holders of the office, Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson, who had run against each other in 2008 and 2012. Johnson, as incumbent mayor, had chosen not to stand for re-election for a third term in office, having been elected as the Conservative Party MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the 2015 general election.

James Brainard is the mayor of Carmel, Indiana, a principal city in the Indianapolis metropolitan area. Brainard, who first took office January 1, 1996, is currently serving his sixth consecutive four-year term, having won a term in the 2015 primary election that will end in 2019. With his victory, Mayor Brainard is one of Indiana's longest serving mayors. He has led a city whose population has grown from 25,000 in 1996 to 100,000 in 2019. His keynote projects have been the creation of a new downtown called City Center, where a new 1,600-seat concert hall, the Palladium, opened in 2011, the redevelopment of the oldest part of town into a new Arts & Design District and building several more city parks and trails.

He was president of the Detroit City Council from 2005 until September 17, 2008, when he was sworn in as the interim mayor, with his term in office beginning September 19. The previous mayor, Kwame Kilpatrick had announced on September 4, 2008 that he would resign after pleading guilty to state charges about his conduct in office. This resulted in Cockrel succeeding him as Mayor of Detroit. Gavin Nigel Xavier Harding MBE (born 18 March 1974) is a British politician and academic who was mayor of Selby, North Yorkshire, England. He was the first person in the United Kingdom to become mayor while being formally diagnosed as having a learning disability. Robert Wensell \"Wense\" Grabarek (May 21, 1919 – December 15, 2019) served as mayor of Durham, North Carolina from 1963 to 1971. Greeted upon entering office with mass civil rights demonstrations, Grabarek was credited with striking a tone of moderation. He established the \"Durham Interim Committee,\" composed of two black and nine white members, with a mandate to “resolve and reconcile” racial differences. Over the next few months, segregation ended at most of Durham's restaurants, hotels and movie theaters, swimming pools, libraries, the chamber of commerce, and the Jaycees. Grabarek also served on the Durham City Council from 1957 to 1961. Amid a major corruption scandal at FIFA, incumbent Sepp Blatter was re-elected to a fifth term as FIFA President during the 65th FIFA Congress on 29 May 2015, defeating Prince Ali bin Hussein of Jordan. On 2 June, Blatter announced his intent to resign, remaining in office until an extraordinary FIFA Congress convened and elected a new president. An extraordinary congress was set for 26 February 2016 by the FIFA Executive Committee in July, who also announced the deadlines for candidates and other necessary procedures. World Mayor is a biennial award organized by The City Mayors Foundation since 2004. It intends to raise the profile of mayors worldwide, as well as honour those who have served their communities well and who have contributed to the well-being of cities, nationally and internationally. The organisers make it plain that the award has no connection with any city or organization and is run on strictly non-commercial lines. Helen Zille and Leopoldo Lopez discussed their 2008 nominations on the BBC World Service programme 'Outlook'. \"The Guardian\" looked at contenders for the 2014 prize.

The IAAF Grand Prix Final was an athletics competition featuring track and field events staged by the International Association of Athletics Federations. It was first held in 1985 and replaced in 2003 by the IAAF World Athletics Final. For the most part of its history, the events were staged in early September in European major cities which also played host to prominent annual athletics meetings. Fukuoka City became the first non-European host in 1997. Doha followed in 2000 (also the first time the event was staged in October) and Melbourne was that last non-European host before the final edition of the competition was held in Paris in 2002. The 2016 IAAF World Challenge was the seventh edition of the annual, global circuit of one-day track and field competitions organized by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).

The Rieti Meeting was originally scheduled for 11 September, but the meeting folded due to financial issues. The 2018 IAAF World Challenge was the ninth edition of the annual, global circuit of one-day track and field competitions organized by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). The series featured a total of nine meetings, with the meetings remaining unchanged from the previous year. The host venue of the Brazilian leg of the series moved from São Bernardo do Campo to Bragança Paulista. The 2012 IAAF World Challenge was the third edition of the annual, global circuit of one-day track and field competitions organized by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). The series featured a total of fourteen meetings – the same number as the previous year as the IAAF World Challenge Dakar and Brothers Znamensky Memorial meetings were dropped to the schedule while the Moscow Challenge and Ponce Grand Prix de Atletismo were added.

The IAAF announced on March 3, 2016, that New York would be replaced immediately by Rabat, Morocco, on the Diamond League tour. Local organizers the same day said they would announce plans to carry on the meet as a street event in New York. Announced with initially four events for 2016, three in Europe and one in the United States, leading to the 2016 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Portland, Oregon, the second edition contained 5 meetings, and took place in a year with no World Indoor championships; therefore qualification places were not applicable.

            "passage:  Kötcse  is a village in Somogy county, Hungary. The village is known for being a summer resort because of its proximity to Lake Balaton and its good weather conditions. Several houses are weekend houses and have no permanent residents. Among others former Prime Minister and leader of the DK political party, Ferenc Gyurcsány spends his holidays here with his family. Since 2004 the settlement and the Dobozy Chateau hosts the \"Polgári Piknik\" meeting organized by the \"Polgári Magyarországért Alapítvány\" of the Christian-conservative elite. Leading figures of Hungarian life - politicians, thinkers, scientists, business people - gather together in the village for the event. Call the Midwife is a BBC period drama series about a group of nurse midwives working in the East End of London in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

The first series, set in 1957, premiered in the UK on 15 January 2012. Hot Milk is a 2016 novel by Deborah Levy. It follows a mother and daughter, Rose and Sofia, who embark on a journey to a Spanish clinic in search of a medical cure for Rose’s paralysis, which confines her to a wheelchair and limits Sofia's freedoms. The proprietor of the clinic, Gómez, is charismatic but may be a quack. While Rose undergoes treatment, 25-year-old Sofia becomes obsessed with Ingrid, a seamstress. Later, Sofia visits her father, from whom she has been estranged, in Athens, and spends time with his new wife and daughter. Athens seems to be in a state of collapse, and the novel pictures both Greece and Spain in the throes of economic and political turmoil. Sofia is an anthropologist by training, and this informs her perspective on events.  Szentendre is a riverside town in Pest County, Hungary, between the capital city Budapest and Pilis-Visegrád Mountains. The town is known for its museums (most notably the ), galleries, and artists. It is the home subcounty of Stephen Kiprotich, men's marathon gold medalist at the 2012 Olympic Games in London. Taksony  is a village of roughly 6,000 inhabitants roughly 23 kilometers south of Budapest, on the bank of the Ráckeve branch of the Danube known as Kisduna (Little Danube). Taksony is known for its many natural springs and tranquil scenery and serves as a haven for fishermen, boaters and summer vacationers. The film is based on the story of Erzsébet Bathory, a Hungarian countess in the 16th and 17th centuries. Her story takes place in a part of the Kingdom of Hungary that is now Slovakia. In this retelling, the Countess is a healer who conducts medical experiments and rudimentary autopsies in a \"hospital\" beneath her castle. She forms a relationship with a reputed witch, Darvulia, who saves her from poisoning. The witch promises Erzsebet a son and eternal beauty. In return, Erzsebet must sacrifice both love and her reputation. Darvulia becomes Erzsebet's companion. Meanwhile, maidens in the area have been dying of seemingly unrelated causes, and Erzsebet is seen bathing in a large tub of red liquid as the girls' now-mutilated corpses are buried nearby. Two monks later conclude that the water is not blood but is simply colored red by herbs. Kudowa-Zdrój is one of the oldest European spa towns where heart and circulatory system diseases were cured. The downtown area features a park styled on 17th century revival, with exotic plants and a mineral water pump room. Due to its location, the town is famous for tourism, hiking and as the departure point for trips.  The Prague Canoeing Centre is one of the most frequently used venues for international canoe slalom competition. Built in 1983 in Czechoslovakia, it diverts water around a dam at Troja on the Vltava river in Prague. Its two unique features are its use of car and truck tires as flow diverters and its shallow slope, closer to 1% than the usual nearly 2% for such venues. Despite these characteristics, the Troja facility has hosted ten World Cup races and one World Championship in the 21 years 1992-2012, and the 2013 World Championships. Set in the fictional war-torn European country Zubrowka in the 1930s, \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" tells the story and friendship of two people: a concierge and the lobby boy as they team up for several misadventures while trying to prove Gustave's innocence after he was framed for murder. \n",

            "passage:  It reached the 41st edition in January 2018. There is no precise format for the tournament, even though recently there were four participating teams. The Carpathian Trophy  is an annual men's and women's friendly handball tournament organised by the Romanian Handball Federation: The Wheelbarrow Olympics (in Hungarian \"Talicskaolimpia\") is an international sports event organized annually in Hosszúhetény village in Baranya county, Hungary. The participants compete individually and in teams, in several categories: solo, double, triple, sandwich and in speed and skill exercises. The most recent Olympic champions, Russia, appeared in the competition. Wealthy industrialist Leopold Trebitsch (1842–1906) was a lover of chess and a patron of chess competitions. His family advanced the considerable sum of 100,000 kronen to the Vienna Chess Club (\"Wiener Schachklub\") to organize a series of tournaments. Since Trebitsch died one month before the start of the first tournament, the competitions were named in his memory. Six of the first nine events (1907–18) were won by Carl Schlechter, but his death in December 1918, along with the loss of the Club's Trebitsch fund in the aftermath of Austria's debacle in World War I, put a temporary halt to the tournament. In 1926, Leopold Trebitsch's son, Oskar, made more funds available, enabling eleven additional competitions to be held until 1938, when Germany's annexation of Austria ended the event.  The 2017 ICC Champions Trophy was the eighth ICC Champions Trophy, a cricket tournament for the eight top-ranked One Day International (ODI) teams in the world. It was held in England and Wales from 1 June to 18 June 2017. Pakistan won the competition for the first time with a 180-run victory over India in the final at The Oval. The margin of victory was the largest by any team in the final of an ICC ODI tournament in terms of runs. The event was originally designed to promote the Great Run, however, the Games soon became a major British athletics event, attracting athletes such as Usain Bolt, David Rudisha and Kim Collins. The first Roll Ball World Cup was held at the Shree Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex in Pune in Maharashtra state of the Republic of India. This was held from 17 April 2011 to 22 April 2011. Denmark was the winner. Host India was the runner-up. The tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final. Shiva Keshavan received 450,000 rupees from five Indian lawyers to purchase a new luge for competition after his previous luge - held together by duct tape and screws - broke during training in November. This was in addition to the funding equivalent to $US20,000 he received from the Ministry of Sports in 2009, money he got after being awarded a bronze medal at the Asian Championships. Although Keshavan had represented his country thrice before, in the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Salt Lake City in 2002 and again in Torino in 2006, 2009 was the first time he received any government support. \n",

            "passage:  As well as being a chance to showcase Austro-Hungarian industry and culture, the World's Fair in Vienna commemorated Franz JosephI's 25th year as emperor. The main grounds were in the Prater, a park near the Danube River, and preparations cost £23.4 million. It lasted from May 1st to November 2nd, hosting about 7,225,000 visitors. The Tower was built between 1968 and 1972 and was ready in time for 1972 Summer Olympics. Its inauguration followed on 18 May 1973. The building is located near the Olympic Village and is often cited as one of the most notable examples of architecture in Munich. The tower's exterior is supposed to mimic the shape of four cylinders in a car engine, with the museum representing a cylinder head. Both buildings were designed by the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer. The tower was designed by Augustus Pugin in a neo-gothic style. When completed in 1859, it was, says horologist Ian Westworth, \"the prince of timekeepers: the biggest, most accurate four-faced striking and chiming clock in the world\". It stands 315 feet (96 m) tall, and the climb from ground level to the belfry is 334 steps. Its base is square, measuring 39 feet (12 m) on each side. Dials of the clock are 23 feet (7.0 m) in diameter. On 31 May 2009, celebrations were held to mark the tower's 150th anniversary. The Prague Canoeing Centre is one of the most frequently used venues for international canoe slalom competition. Built in 1983 in Czechoslovakia, it diverts water around a dam at Troja on the Vltava river in Prague. Its two unique features are its use of car and truck tires as flow diverters and its shallow slope, closer to 1% than the usual nearly 2% for such venues. Despite these characteristics, the Troja facility has hosted ten World Cup races and one World Championship in the 21 years 1992-2012, and the 2013 World Championships. The sixteen ton world clock was opened to the public on 30 September 1969, shortly before the twentieth anniversary of the German Democratic Republic, along with the Berlin TV Tower (\"\"). The erection of the clock was part of a larger plan to expand and reorganize Alexanderplatz as a whole. At the end of the renovations, the public square was four times larger than it was at the end of the World War II. The Great Berlin Wheel was a giant Ferris wheel to be built near the Berlin Zoological Garden (Zoologischer Garten Berlin) in Berlin, Germany, by the Great Wheel Corporation. The Giurgiu Clocktower  is a Historic Monument located in the City of Giurgiu, Romania. It has been designated by the Romanian Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony as monument of national importance. The city of Girgiu is located on the Danube river near the Bulgarian border. The city's location on the river made it a strategic asset for the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans started construction of the tower in 1770 and completed construction in 1771. Its initial purpose was to function as a military watchtower used for surveillance over the city and the river. It was later used as a lookout for fire prevention, similar to the \"guet royal\" and \"guet bourgeois\" (\"burgess watch\") established in France, which lasted until the 18th century. After the Ottoman Empire lost control of the area, the tower underwent several modifications becoming what is known today as the Giurgiu Clocktower. The tower was constructed by Gazi Husrev-beg, a governor of the area during the Ottoman period. The earliest known documented mention of the tower dates to the 17th century in a work by Evliya Celebi. It was rebuilt twice, once after fire damage when the city was attacked by Eugene of Savoy in 1697, and in 1762. Gardoš Tower , also known as Millennium Tower  or Kula Sibinjanin Janka (, \"The Tower of Janos Hunyadi\") is a memorial tower located in Zemun, city of Belgrade in Serbia. It was built and officially opened on 20 August 1896 to celebrate a thousand years of Hungarian settlement in the Pannonian plain. The Millennium project included seven monuments in total all over the Hungarian part of Austro-Hungary, with Gardoš Tower being the southernmost. They are all different and not all of them are towers. The Wiener Riesenrad (German for Vienna Giant Wheel), or Riesenrad, is a tall Ferris wheel at the entrance of the Prater amusement park in Leopoldstadt, the 2nd district of Austria's capital Vienna. It is one of Vienna's most popular tourist attractions, and symbolises the district as well as the city for many people. Constructed in 1897, it was the world's tallest extant Ferris wheel from 1920 until 1985. \n",

            "passage:  Kulcsár was elected President of the Hungarian Olympic Committee (MOB) on 2 May 2017, replacing Zsolt Borkai. Along with Tokyo, Madrid earned the top scores during the Applicant phase, after a detailed study of the Applicant Files received by the IOC Working Group on January 14, 2008. Between May 4 and May 9, 2009, the IOC Evaluation Commission, led by Nawal El Moutawakel, arrived in Madrid to assess the conditions of the city. The Commission attended technical presentations, participated in question-and-answer sessions about the Candidature File and made inspections in all the existing venues across the city. Rio de Janeiro won the final round by a margin of 34 votes over Madrid in a three-round exhaustive ballot of the IOC. Gorzów is known for its successful sportsmen, including Olympic and world champions and national representatives. The city is also known as the hometown of former Polish Prime Minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz. Zsolt Borkai (born August 31, 1965) is a Hungarian Olympic gymnast champion and politician, who served as the mayor of Győr from 1 October 2006 to 8 November 2019. He was President of the Hungarian Olympic Committee (MOB) between 20 November 2010 and 2 May 2017. Momentum Movement (, shortly Momentum or M) is a centrist Hungarian political party founded in March 2017. It came to national prominence as a political association in January 2017 after organizing a petition about the Budapest bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics, calling for a public referendum on the matter. The petition, which gathered over 266 151 signatures, was successful, but the government cancelled the Olympic bid before a referendum could have been held. After its establishment as a political party, Momentum quickly built a national following, and presently has approximately 4,000 members. Ferenc Kemény (17 July 1860, in Nagybecskerek, now Zrenjanin, Serbia – 21 November 1944, in Budapest) was a Hungarian educator and humanist, whose international recognition degree was established as a founding member of the International Olympic Committee and his role in the contemporary peace movement. Zappas' contribution in this process was vital: not only were the games hosted at his own initiative, he also provided the funds for the staging of the games, as well as for the construction of much-needed infrastructure, including the refurbishment of the ancient Panathenaic Stadium, which hosted the Games of 1870 and 1875. The same stadium would also host the first IOC Games of 1896, the 1906 Intercalated Games, and archery and the marathon finish at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games. The Budapest bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics and Summer Paralympics was announced by the Hungarian Olympic Committee  on 11 November 2013, although organisers had been planning a bid since 2008. However, on 1 March 2017 Budapest withdrew its bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics, leaving only Los Angeles and Paris in the race. In February 2015, the MOB recommended that the bid plan go forward and with the General Assembly of Budapest began work on detailed cooperation for the Games. Then in January 2016, city authorities approved the master-plan for the potential Olympic Games locations. This was the first election to not feature either of the two previous holders of the office, Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson, who had run against each other in 2008 and 2012. Johnson, as incumbent mayor, had chosen not to stand for re-election for a third term in office, having been elected as the Conservative Party MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the 2015 general election. The campaign was dominated by the personal battle between Goldsmith and Khan, and their contrasting class and ethnic backgrounds. Through his victory, Khan became the second Labour Party Mayor of London after Livingstone, and the first Muslim mayor of a European Union capital city. \n",

Prize money for each Players Championship (excluding Australia and Canada) and UK Open Qualifier increased from £29,600 in 2009 to £31,200 in 2010. Prize money for Australian and Canadian Players Championships remained unchanged at £21,600 per event. At controlled airports, take-off or landing clearances do not authorize the pilot to reverse course and backtrack along the runway, unless specified by air traffic control. At uncontrolled airports, pilots are recommended to broadcast their intentions while backtracking in the interest of safety; for example, the statement \"Entering and backtracking runway 36\" would indicate the aircraft is taxiing along a magnetic heading of 180 degrees, against the flow of traffic. The game uses the hand rankings from Brag. Three of a kind, (a prial), is the best hand followed by a running flush, then a run, then a flush, then a pair followed by a high card. If a hand is otherwise similar then the card is ranked by high card or high pair, then by middle card or kicker, then low card. No suits are higher valued than any other.

The Hitchin Flyover is a grade-separated single-track railway viaduct on the Great Northern Route near Hitchin, Hertfordshire, England, which carries the \"Down Cambridge Flyover line\" over the East Coast Main Line. Constructed between 2012 and 2013, it was built to increase the throughput at \"Cambridge Junction\", a congested flat (\"at-grade\") junction with the East Coast Main Line just north of , which put severe constraints on capacity on both that line and the Cambridge Line. The Rosie Hackett Bridge (Irish: \"Droichead Róise Haicéid\") is a road and tram bridge in Dublin, Ireland, which opened on 20 May 2014. Spanning the River Liffey and joining Marlborough Street to Hawkins Street, it is used solely by public transport, taxis, cyclists and pedestrians. It is 26 metres wide and 48 metres long, and is a single span, smooth concrete structure, with the underside of the bridge designed to be as high above the water as possible so that river traffic is not impeded. It was built to carry the extended Luas Green line, and was budgeted at €15 million. It is named for trade unionist Rosie Hackett. The bridge structure is a temporary construction, erected on permanent footings, and was first erected to serve visitors to the Reading Festival in 2008 at an initial cost of £1 million. The intention was that the bridge would be dismantled and stored for most of the year, being re-erected for future festivals. It replaced a ferry service operated in previous years, which caused complaints over excessive queues. A crossing had been proposed as early as 2005, however financial uncertainties caused significant delay until funding was approved by HM Treasury. Originally an ambitious design was selected, but was later dropped after several contractors withdrew. In 2014, the project switched to a cheaper cable-stayed design. The relationship between the New South Wales Government and Acciona Infrastructure – the construction company delivering the line - has deteriorated. A media report from December 2016 claimed a dispute had arisen between the parties over costs incurred from modifications to the line's design. Acciona commenced legal action against the government in April 2018. The company is seeking additional payments totalling $1.2 billion. Later in the month ALTRAC told the government it was working towards a completion date of March 2020. The crossing was announced as a ferry route by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, in 2012 following the cancellation of the Thames Gateway Bridge, with a proposed operation date of 2017. Subsequent reports suggesting a bridge or a tunnel have put the opening date around 2025. Wynyard Crossing is a new double bascule walking / cycling bridge built in 2011 in Auckland, New Zealand. It connects the redeveloped Wynyard Quarter with Te Wero Island and the existing Viaduct Harbour entertainment district, and thereby, with the wider Auckland waterfront. The bridge is able to lift to allow watercraft passage into the Viaduct Harbour area, with a channel created by lifting two 22 m movable sections. Even closed and at high tide, the bridge will still allow a 3 m clearance, meaning smaller boats do not require the spans to be raised. Opening and closing the bridge will take 90, respectively 60 seconds, controlled by an on-site operator contactable by boats via radio. The Environmentally Friendly Linkage System , abbreviated to EFLS and commonly called the Kai Tak Monorail , is a government-proposed monorail system in the Kai Tak Development area, Hong Kong with 12 stations. The system's construction was estimated to start in 2018 for completion in 2023. The new links are expected to account for 15 percent of public transportation in the Kowloon East Development. The system is expected to cost $12 billion Hong Kong dollars. The Vaux Bridge is a future pedestrian and cycle footbridge planned for construction over the River Wear in Sunderland. It will link the city's Vaux Site with the adjacent area of Monkwearmouth and the Stadium of Light. The bridge was confirmed to be part of a £500 million redevelopment deal to Sunderland City announced in November 2019 by Legal & General. \n",

            "passage:  In October 2018, the venue hosted the Japan Open Tennis Championships as the Ariake Coliseum is being renovated for the tennis events at the 2020 Summer Olympics. The International 2019 (TI9) was the ninth iteration of The International, an annual \"Dota 2\" world championship esports tournament. Hosted by Valve, the game's developer, the tournament followed a year-long series of awarding qualifying points, known as the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC), with the top 12 ranking teams being directly invited to the tournament, which took place in August 2019 at the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai. In addition, six more teams earned invites through regional qualifiers played in July 2019. The grand finals took place between Team Liquid and OG, who had respectively won the International's 2017 and 2018 events. There, OG defeated Team Liquid 3-1 in the best-of-five series to become the first-ever repeat champion of an International. From late 2015 until early 2017, Valve sponsored a series of smaller-scale, seasonally held tournaments known as the Dota Major Championships. Their format was based on the that Valve also sponsored for their first-person shooter game, \"\". Including The International 2016 and 2017, which were considered to be the cumulative Major of their respective seasons, the series had five other events, which were the Frankfurt Major, Shanghai Major, Manila Major, Boston Major, and Kiev Major. Following the International 2017, the Majors were replaced with the DPC due to criticism by teams and fans for Valve's non-transparent and unpredictable nature for handing out International invitations. In 2009, with the restructuring of the WTA tour and the retirement of both Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin, the tournament lost its status of being a WTA tour tournament and evolved into an annual exhibition tennis event before returning to the WTA calendar in 2015. Later this year, however, WTA announced that in 2016, The Diamond Games would be replaced on the WTA Calendar with a new tournament in St. Petersburg, Russia. Demolition was completed in May 2015, and the site will be redeveloped with a new larger-capacity National Olympic Stadium. The new stadium is set to be the main venue for the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. This is a list of host cities of the Olympic Games and Youth Olympic Games, both summer and winter, since the modern Olympics began in 1896. Since then, summer games have usually –  but not always –  celebrated a four-year period known as an Olympiad. There have been 28  Summer Olympic Games held in 23 cities, and 23 Winter Olympic Games held in 20 cities. In addition, three summer and two winter editions of the Games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war: Berlin (summer) in 1916; Tokyo/Helsinki (summer) and Sapporo/Garmisch-Partenkirchen (winter) in 1940; and London (summer) and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy (winter) in 1944. The 1906 Summer Olympics were officially sanctioned and held in Athens. However, in 1949, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), decided to unrecognize the 1906 Games.  The Youth Olympic Games  are held every four years in staggered summer and winter events consistent with the current Olympic Games format, though in reverse order with Winter Games held in leap years instead of Summer Games. The first summer version was held in Singapore from 14 to 26 August 2010 while the first winter version was held in Innsbruck, Austria from 13 to 22 January 2012. The age limitation of the athletes is 14 to 18. Jacques Rogge, IOC President, formally announced plans for the Youth Olympic Games at the 119th IOC session in Guatemala City on 6 July 2007.  There are several goals for the YOG, and four of them include bringing together the world's best young athletes, offering an introduction into Olympism, innovating in educating and debating Olympic values.  The city of Singapore was announced as the host of the inaugural Summer Youth Olympics on 21 February 2008.  On 12 December 2008 the IOC announced that Innsbruck, host of the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics, would be the host of the inaugural Winter Youth Olympics in 2012.Seven cities have been chosen by the IOC to host upcoming Olympic Games and Youth Olympic Games: Buenos Aires for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics, Lausanne for the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics, Tokyo for the 2020 Summer Olympics, Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics, either Abuja, Dakar, Gaborone or Tunis for the 2022 Summer Youth Olympics, Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics, and Los Angeles for the 2028 Summer Olympics. The host is determined by bidding for the first time. Two bids by Hanoi and Seoul were submitted in March 2017. The host was determined by interim members of the Oceania-Asia Quidditch Committee with representatives from Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam. The record for a basketball game is 5,041, set on April 6, 2019, when the Gunma Crane Thunders defeated the Ibaraki Robots. The Japan Open (currently sponsored by Rakuten) is a men's tennis tournament held in Ariake Tennis Forest Park with its center court Ariake Coliseum, located in Koto, Tokyo, Japan. In 2018, the venue switched to the Musashino Forest Sports Plaza as the Ariake Coliseum is being renovated for the tennis events at the 2020 Summer Olympics. Held since 1973, the championship includes men's singles and doubles competitions. In September 2018, the venue hosted the Toray Pan Pacific Open as the Ariake Coliseum is being renovated for the tennis events at the 2020 Summer Olympics. \n",

            "passage:  As First Division clubs, both Manchester United and Nottingham Forest entered the League Cup in the second round. Both sides were drawn at home for the first leg, with Manchester United taking on Second Division Cambridge United and Nottingham Forest taking on Third Division Bolton Wanderers. Manchester United managed a 3–0 win in their first leg at Old Trafford, with goals from Ryan Giggs, Brian McClair and Steve Bruce, before an early goal from McClair set up a 1–1 draw at the Abbey Stadium. Meanwhile, Forest won 4–0 in their first leg match, before a 5–2 win in the second leg for a 9–2 aggregate score. The 1992 Football League Cup Final was a football match played on 12 April 1992 at Wembley Stadium, London, to determine the winner of the 1991–92 Football League Cup. The match was contested by Manchester United and Nottingham Forest. Manchester United won 1–0 to win the League Cup for the first time, with Brian McClair scoring the only goal. The 1993 Football League Cup Final took place on 18 April 1993 at Wembley Stadium, and was played between Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday. Arsenal won 2–1 in normal time, in what was the first of three Wembley finals between the two sides that season; Arsenal and Wednesday also met in the FA Cup Final of that year (which went to a replay), the only time this has ever happened in English football. The competition began on 20 August 1991, and ended with the final on 12 April 1992 at the Old Wembley Stadium. The trophy was won by Manchester United for the first time. The 1993–94 FA Cup was the 113th staging of the world and England's oldest cup competition, the Football Association Cup or FA Cup. The competition overall was won by Manchester United for the first time since 1990, with a 4–0 thrashing of Chelsea. It was Arsenal's sixth FA Cup Final victory, and their first since the 1979 FA Cup Final. They became the first English side to achieve a domestic cup double, having also won the 1993 Football League Cup Final. The 1992 FA Cup Final was contested by Liverpool and Sunderland at Wembley. Liverpool won 2–0, with goals from Michael Thomas and Ian Rush. The 1993 FA Cup Final was contested by Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday at Wembley. The original match, played on 15 May 1993, finished 1–1. Arsenal won the replay on 20 May, 2–1 after extra-time. As of 20 August 2017, there have been 180 competitive first-class meetings between the two teams since the first league meeting in 1909, of which Arsenal have won 75 and Tottenham 56. The most goals in one game were scored in the closely contested 5–4 Arsenal Premiership victory at White Hart Lane on 13 November 2004. The biggest winning margin was a 6–0 away win by Arsenal on 6 March 1935. Tottenham have twice won 5–0 (25 December 1911 and 4 April 1983) and Arsenal once (23 December 1978), with all three fixtures taking place at White Hart Lane. Arsenal also won by 5-2 margins both in February and November of 2012 home at the Emirates. This was Arsenal's 12th's Charity Shield appearance and Manchester United's 17th. The 1993 staging of the event was the first to feature players wearing permanent squad numbers; this became common practise in time for the 1993–94 season. Roy Keane made his debut for Manchester United in the match; he partnered Paul Ince in midfield. United began the match the brighter of the two teams and scored after eight minutes of play, through Mark Hughes. Striker Eric Cantona spurned two chances to extend United's lead, by which point Arsenal's midfield started to assert themselves. Five minutes before the interval, Ian Wright capitalised on a mistake by Ryan Giggs to score the equaliser. Arsenal started the second half strongly, which prompted Ferguson to tweak his formation and bring on Bryan Robson in place of Giggs. Eddie McGoldrick came on for his Arsenal debut in the 74th minute, and two minutes later, United were denied a penalty after Ince was brought down by John Jensen. \n",

            "passage:  For the 2nd time in 3 seasons and the first time since 2008, all Western Conference playoff teams had at least 50 wins. The 7 games separating 1–8 was tied for the smallest margin, also from 2008. The Warriors entered the series having home-court advantage with a regular season record of , compared to the Cavaliers' regular season record of . Entering the matchup, the Warriors were also noted by various sports media outlets as one of the biggest NBA Finals favorites in recent history, drawing some comparisons to the 2001 Finals, where the Los Angeles Lakers, led by Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, were heavily favored over the Philadelphia 76ers, led by Allen Iverson. The Lakers would go on to win the Finals four games to one. This was the first time since 2012 that the Finals did not feature either of the top seeds in each conference. The 2018 Finals began on May 31 and ended on June 8. The series broke the record set by the 2014 NBA Finals for highest average scoring differential per game (15.0) for an NBA Finals series. The 2010 NBA Finals was the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s championship series for the 2009–10 season. The best-of-seven playoff was contested between the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers (who were also defending NBA champions), and the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics. The Lakers defeated the Celtics, four games to three, to win the franchise's 16th NBA championship. The 64th edition of the championship series was played between June 3 and June 17, was broadcast on ABC, and was watched by an average of 18.1 million people. The 2010 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2009-10 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeating the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics 4 games to 3 in the NBA Finals. Kobe Bryant was named NBA Finals MVP for the second straight year. Since the league's inception in 2001–02, a variety of formats has been used to determine the champion. From the inaugural postseason in 2002 through 2006, the four teams with the best records advanced to the postseason because there were no division or conference splits to divide the eight teams. The first two seasons, both semi-finals and the Finals series were in a best-of-three format, whereby a team must win two of the three games to advance or win the championship (the best-of-three would resume again in 2008 and is still used today). Then, between 2004 and 2007, the playoffs used a single-elimination tournament among the four teams, with two semi-final games and one winner-takes-all championship match. The Celtics earned their berth into the playoffs by winning the Atlantic Division. The Lakers won the Pacific Division to earn their berth. The Celtics reached the NBA Finals by defeating the Miami Heat in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference First Round, the Cleveland Cavaliers in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference Semifinals, and defending Eastern conference champion Orlando Magic in the best-of-seven . The Lakers reached the NBA Finals by defeating the Oklahoma City Thunder in the best-of-seven Western Conference First Round, the Utah Jazz in the best-of-seven Western Conference Semifinals, and the Phoenix Suns in the best-of-seven . The NBA Finals were scheduled in the Major League Baseball World Series 2–3–2 seven game format, with the Lakers possessing home-court advantage as a reward for finishing with better regular season record than the Celtics. On March 10, 2018, the Spurs finished with a losing season on the road for the first time since 1997 after a loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, but with a win against the Washington Wizards on March 21, 2018, the Spurs clinched an NBA record 21st consecutive winning season. With a loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on April 3, 2018, the streak of 20 straight seasons of 50 wins or more (and 20 straight seasons with a record of .600 or better) ended for the Spurs. The streak lasted since the 1997–98 season, which also was the first year of the Tim Duncan era, not counting the shortened lockout season, also the year they won their first championship title. Despite that, the Spurs clinched their 21st consecutive playoff spot on April 9, 2018 with a win over the Sacramento Kings in their last home game of the season. They finished the regular season with 47–35, which clinched the 7th seed. In the playoffs, the Spurs faced the second seeded and eventual NBA champion Golden State Warriors, the team that swept them in last season's Western Conference Finals, in the First Round, and lost in five games. The highest rated and most watched NBA Final series was 1998 NBA Finals between the Chicago Bulls and Utah Jazz,; the series averaged an 18.7 rating / 33 share and 29.04 million viewers on NBC. The lowest rated and least watched NBA Final series was 2007 NBA Finals between the San Antonio Spurs and Cleveland Cavaliers; the series averaged a 6.2 rating / 11 share and 9.29 million viewers on ABC. Going into the series, the Heat were heavy favorites with their newly acquired superstars LeBron James and Chris Bosh along with returning superstar Dwyane Wade. The following is a listing of all 30 current National Basketball Association (NBA) teams ranked by win-loss record percentage, accurate as of the end of the 2016–17 NBA season. The records do not count wins and losses recorded by a team's playing time in the American Basketball Association (ABA), despite the 1976 NBA-ABA merger. The San Antonio Spurs have the highest win-loss record percentage, with .624. The Minnesota Timberwolves have the lowest win-loss record percentage, with .391. The Boston Celtics have recorded the most wins, with 3,274, while the Sacramento Kings have recorded the most losses at 2,955. The Boston Celtics lead the association with the most played games, with 5,560. Conversely, the Pelicans have played the least overall games, with 1,132. \n",

He sends an invitation to Rachel for the opening night performance. Although extremely hesitant at first, Rachel eventually decides to attend. After the performance Rachel congratulates Peter and tells him she's looking into attending school in the area. She leaves so Peter can bask in the success of his show, but quickly returns to Peter's dressing room to tell him she misses him. Peter tells her that he has missed her, too. The film ends as they embrace and kiss. Peter and John is a 2015 American drama film written and directed by Jay Craven and starring Jacqueline Bisset and Christian Coulson. It is based on Guy de Maupassant's novel \"Pierre et Jean\". In the film's spy sub-plot, set before the events of the performance, Kevin is secret agent for MI6 (Agent 0054) and attends a poker game event with his date Money Berry (Halle Berry), only for it to go horribly wrong. O'Connell first found fame as the hard-living James Cook on the E4 teen series \"Skins\" (2009–2010), which was followed by other lead roles in the television dramas \"Dive\" (2010) and \"United\" (2011). His breakthrough came when he gave critically acclaimed performances in the independent films \"Starred Up\" (2013) and \"'71\" (2014). O'Connell subsequently starred as war hero Louis Zamperini in his first major Hollywood picture, Angelina Jolie's \"Unbroken\" (2014), for which he received the BAFTA Rising Star Award. In 2016, he co-starred with George Clooney and Julia Roberts in \"Money Monster\", a film directed by Jodie Foster.

Man in an Orange Shirt is a two-part British television movie from the BBC. It was produced by Kudos Film and Television and premiered on 31 July 2017 at BBC One. The film drama tells three love stories from two generations of a family, in the 1940s and in 2017. Shellshocked following his experiences as a POW, naval war hero Mike Merriworth (Kieron Moore) enrols as a physical instructor at an Outward Bound sea school in Wales, and discovers new purpose shaping the lives of the boys in his charge. As described in a film publication, John Wesley Pringle (Carey), an adventurer, returns to Gadsden to claim the girl Stella (Golden), only to find out that she is in love with Chris Foy (Steele). A young Londoner called Peter (Christopher Matthews) has sexual encounters with a string of women including an au pair, a model, a blues singer, a hippie, a high-class lady, incestuous twins and a girl next door.

The flag that Rob Halford is kissing on the cover of the album is the Flag of Chile. \"Sign of a Victory\" is a song by American singer R. Kelly, featuring the South African gospel choir Soweto Spiritual Singers. It was the official anthem for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Released on June 6 for digital download, the song received generally positive critical reception, and became a minor hit. \"Football Is Our Religion\" is a country-dance song by the Swedish band Rednex, released in 2008 via Universal Records, as the fifth single of their independently released third studio album \"The Cotton Eye Joe Show\". The song serves as the unofficial song to UEFA Euro 2008 which took place in Austria and Switzerland in June of that year. A Decade is Canadian alternative rock band Our Lady Peace's first compilation album, released on November 21, 2006, in Canada, and November 28, 2006, in the United States. In addition to songs from the band's first six albums, the set included two unreleased songs, \"Kiss on the Mouth\" and \"Better Than Here\". After \"Frankreich '84\" was embargoed, the band wrote a new song for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. \"Señoritas in arm, Tequila lukewarm / troubled by diarrhea and hunted by flies / In the land of the cactus, we will be - you will see - world champion, world champion again.\" Mexico is one of the biggest countries. The song is often sung by German soccer fans by matches, so for example at the World Cup match Germany - Sweden in 2006. In 2005, Christie had a hit with a Comic Relief re-release of \"\"Amarillo\"\" with Peter Kay that reached number 1 on the UK singles charts for 7 weeks in a row. The BBC Three Counties Radio presenters Ian Stringer and George Webley wrote alternate lyrics to Amarillo to support England at the World Cup, which the song predicts England will win. Christie was convinced to record the song using those lyrics by the BBC Radio 1 presenter Chris Moyles. The music video for it was filmed at Barnet F.C.'s Underhill Stadium in London. Christie initially said about it: \"It's got a nice summery feel about it and people seem to like it\" and the BBC commissioned him to review other 2006 World Cup songs competing with him. The \"Manchester Evening News\" said about \"Is This the Way to The World Cup\" that: \"It's that cheesy, it's a classic\". Like with \"\"Amarillo\"\" the year before, the profits for the single went to charity, specifically SportsAid. In 1929, Argentina hosted a new edition of the South American championship, winning its second consecutive title. Argentina finished unbeaten once more, defeating all its rivals in the group: Peru (3–0), Paraguay (4–1) and Uruguay in the last match played in the Estadio Gasómetro of Buenos Aires. Most of players that took part of the team would play for Argentina in the first World Cup organized by FIFA one year later. \"Red Nation\" is a 2011 song by The Game. The song \"Highlander (The One)\" achieved popularity in the early 2010s as an Internet meme, often paired with a scene from the animated film \"\".

            "passage:  The song's music video was directed by Marcos Siega and photographed by cinematographer Steve Gainer ASC ASK. It features the band performing amongst a crowd. The song was premiered audio-only on YouTube. A dystopian-themed black-and-white music video was released a week later, on 9 February. The music video, as well as the animated visuals with flying flags and marching boots for the audio-only video, were directed and designed by Anton Corbijn. The song's accompanying video is directed by Jake Scott. The band is performing in an industrial apartment, suggested by the opening shots of the video to be the Balfron Tower (not to be mistaken with Trellick Tower), as the building's tenants (including a man with a baby, a young boy, an old man and a female cyclist, an elderly woman with a hair dryer, a middle-aged woman in a house coat, a mafia boss and two bodyguards, an Indian couple, a drug addict, another elderly woman, and young woman and her mother) take offense to the loud noise of the band's playing and come up to knock on the door and look in the mail slot. The video concludes with all the tenants gathering around the door, beating on it and yelling, just as the band finishes playing and packs up their instruments. As of 2017 the music video had over 12 million views on YouTube. The music video for \"Weapon\" was directed by Matthew Good and Ante Kovac. It was filmed on October 5, 2002 at Pier 94. In a later commentary, Good related that Kovac's first edit of the video was far too standard, with gratuitous and generic fades. After firing Kovac, Good flew to Toronto and worked with video editor Jay Deschamps to re-craft the footage. While working on the edit, Good began to experiment with overlaying text and adding still frames and stock photos to help deliver the message. Good noted that he felt that the video was his favourite from his catalogue. The music video features MC Ren rapping in an abandoned warehouse. Scenes from \"CB4\" were seen in the music video. Chris Rock and Allen Payne made cameo appearances in the music video. A promotional video, directed by Piers Bedford, was the band's first. It contains live footage of D.I. performing \"Richard Hung Himself\", T.S.O.L. performing \"Wash Away\" and \"Darker My Love\", and The Vandals performing \"The Legend of Pat Brown\". In turn, the film inspired the Pet Shop Boys song \"Suburbia.\" The music video is unusual for Eskimo Joe, featuring lead singer Kavyen Temperley changing T-shirts. It is filmed on the streets of New York, whilst Temperley walks backward with smoke coming out of his mouth. It then pans to the band running in Central Park in a similar style to the \"Who Sold Her Out\" video. Chris (Rob Lowe) has fired Denis Cooper, the former health department public relations director, who hung posters around city hall to publicly condemn his adulterous wife. Leslie (Amy Poehler) suggests Ann (Rashida Jones) replace him, mainly because they can spend more time together, since Ann has been so busy dating numerous men. Although reluctant to leave her job as a nurse, Ann agrees to attend the job interview, and Leslie provides her with an overwhelming amount of reading material to prepare for it. Meanwhile, Tom (Aziz Ansari) encourages the parks department to attend the Snakehole Lounge, a nightclub he partially owns with his friend Jean-Ralphio Saperstein (Ben Schwartz), for the unveiling of his new alcoholic beverage, Snake Juice. Tom also encourages them to spread the word about the drink through word of mouth guerilla marketing. April (Aubrey Plaza) shows little interest in attending, until Andy (Chris Pratt) suggests they make a game of it by role-playing as different people at the bar. April pretends to be Janet Snakehole, an aristocratic widow with a dark secret, while Andy poses as his frequent alter-ego, FBI agent Burt Macklin. \"You Are the Reason\" is a song by British singer-songwriter Calum Scott. It was released on 17 November 2017 via Capitol Records, as his second original single from his debut album Only Human. It was produced by Grammy Award-winning record producer Fraser T Smith and has sold over 2 million copies worldwide. The music video was filmed entirely in Kiev, Ukraine. \n",

Only Honolulu (population 374,660), 3,841 km (2,387 mi) from San Francisco, is more isolated. Ugla, an unrefined girl from the countryside, moves from an outlying area of Northern Iceland to the capital city of Reykjavík in order to work for Búi Árland, a member of parliament, and to learn how to play the organ. She’s met with a world that’s completely foreign to her: politicians and the military move freely about the city, and she views city residents as spoiled, snobbish and arrogant. In contrast, she comes from a rural area where the Icelandic Sagas of the Middle Ages constitute the majority of what people discuss and ponder and are viewed as more important than reality. These historical backgrounds are certainly important and provide crucial patterns. The prime minister subsequently carries out secret dealings with the Americans and “sells” the country. Ugla, however, also confronts other current issues, above all in the organ player’s house. There, she comes in contact with communist and anarchist mindsets and likewise protests the construction of an atom station in Iceland. After a short relationship with Búi Árland, Ugla decides to return to the “selfconscious policeman”, who is the father of her recently born child.

He first appeared in commercials for McDonald's, beginning in 1971 and continuing for more than 20 years, portraying The Hamburglar. In the eight films that comprise the first season, Rossellini enacts the mating rituals of various insects and other animals (including the dragonfly, spider, bee, praying mantis, earthworm, snail and housefly) with cardboard cut-outs and foam-rubber sculptures. Season two is devoted to marine life. Season three deals with ocean life threatened by commercial fishing. In Reef City, an underachieving bluestreak cleaner wrasse named Oscar fantasizes about being rich and famous while making his way to work as a tongue scrubber at the local Whale Wash, a job in which he is following in his father's footsteps. Soon after arriving he is called to the office of his boss, a pufferfish named Sykes, to discuss the fact that he owes \"five thousand clams\" and has to pay it back by the next day. After explaining this to his angelfish best friend Angie, she offers him a chance to pay back the money by pawning a pink pearl that was a gift from her grandmother. Oscar brings the money to the race track to meet Sykes, but becomes distracted by his dreams of grandeur. Upon hearing that the race is rigged, he places it all on a long-shot bet by the name of \"Lucky Day\". Such a million dollar bet is noticed nearby by a beautiful lionfish named Lola, who flagrantly seduces an excited Oscar, but Oscar is disappointed when she leaves upon learning that he is a whale washer. Sykes is furious that Oscar bet the money but nonetheless agrees to see how the race turns out. Moments before their betted \"horse\" crosses the finish line, he trips and falls on the line. Commonly considered a blaxploitation film, the plot centers on Moore's character, a retired cop who owns and operates a disco and tries to shut down the local angel dust (PCP) dealer after his nephew (Julius Carry) gets \"whacked out\" on the drug. Another PCP user's claim to have served her own baby as Easter dinner constitutes a version of the urban legend known as \"The Baby-Roast.\" Beer (also known as The Selling of America) is a 1985 American comedy film produced by Orion Pictures that satirizes the advertising industry, specifically the TV commercial industry. Sam Paley's wife, Goldie Drell Paley, appeared in Spanish costume on cigar box interior and exterior images. Liberally translated from Spanish, \"La Palina\" is derived from \"the female Paley\", hence the portrait used in marketing the product. Lawrence Donald Clark (born January 19, 1943) is an American film director, photographer, writer and film producer who is best known for his controversial teen film \"Kids\" (1995) and his photography book \"Tulsa\". His work focuses primarily on youth who casually engage in illegal drug use, underage sex, and violence, and who are part of a specific subculture, such as surfing, punk rock, or skateboarding. It features a split-screen view of a crab's view of the underwater world in which his independently moving eyes (on eye stalks) see the world completely differently from each other. The worm and the fisherman are caricatures of Jerry Colonna, and the title is a reference to his weekly greeting on Bob Hope's radio show, \"Greetings, Gates\". The same worm was also featured in the 1941 Warner's cartoon, \"The Wacky Worm\". Paper Street Soap Co. is a fictional company created by Tyler Durden in the book \"Fight Club\" by author Chuck Palahniuk and popularized by its film adaptation starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. \n",

            "passage:  The song is also sung at association football clubs around the world, where it is performed by a massed chorus of supporters on matchday; this tradition began at Liverpool F.C. in the early 1960s. Chelsea's performances and results were erratic throughout the season, typified by large victories over Arsenal, Newcastle United and West Bromwich Albion and heavy defeats against Manchester United, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Burnley, culminating in a sixth consecutive mid-table finish since their Championship success in 1955. The club were also victims of an upset in the FA Cup, losing 2–1 at home to Fourth Division side Crewe Alexandra. The 1961–62 season was Port Vale's 50th season of football in the English Football League, and their third season in the Third Division. The season was most notable for the win over Sunderland in the FA Cup, which followed a goalless draw at Roker Park in which the Vale defence prevented Brian Clough from even having a shot. The club also hosted a friendly against the Czechoslovakia national football team, and later took a tour of Poland. In the league they failed to gain promotion, and had to settle for mid-table obscurity. Attendances were now at a worrying all-time low and so the Stoke board and manager Tony Waddington decided something needed to be done to bring the supporters back to the Victoria Ground. And Waddington pulled off a master stroke after paying £3,000 to Blackpool for the returning 46-year-old Stanley Matthews. Crowds instantly arrived in large numbers with Matthews first match back against Huddersfield Town more than 35,000 turned up a good 15,000 more than the last home match. Stoke could not sustain a push for promotion, but the feeling around the club had changed dramatically. The pre-season saw general manager Stanley Matthews injured in a car accident with a National Coal Board lorry on 29 July, Jackie Mudie was also in the car but remained relatively unharmed. As Matthews recovered in came four new forwards, the most significant of which was Crystal Palace's Ian Lawson. Lawson cost £1,000 with an additional £1,000 signing on fee. Other new faces included winger Mick Mahon (Loughborough United); inside-forward Jimmy Goodfellow (Bishop Auckland); and Billy McCartney (Rangers). There was a kit change to an all-white strip, upon the suggestion of Stanley Matthews. Everton won the First Division title for the sixth time in the club's history that season. They made sure of the title on May 11, after a 4-1 win over Fulham at Goodison Park. Leyton Orient were relegated on May 4, with a 3-1 defeat at Sheffield Wednesday. Manchester City joined them on the final weekend of the season, losing 6-1 at West Ham United which saved Birmingham City, who won 3-2 at home against Leicester City. Due to fixture congestion, the second leg was not played until after the start of the 1961–2 season. As a result, Villa began their defence of the trophy just eight days after winning it. Though all League clubs were eligible to participate, Arsenal, Sheffield Wednesday, West Bromwich Albion, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur, did not enter. The prize money for winning the competition was £750. The two clubs would not play each other again until they met in the same competition in August 2013. Both clubs received first round byes. Manchester United won the First Division title for the seventh time in the club's history that season. They made sure of that on 6 May, after beating West Ham United 6–1 at Upton Park whilst their title challengers Nottingham Forest lost 2–1 at Southampton. Blackpool were relegated on 15 April, after losing 2–0 at Stoke City whilst Aston Villa joined them on 6 May, after losing 4–2 at home against Everton with Southampton's win against Nottingham Forest confirming their relegation. Three still-standing but unwanted club-records were set this season: a record 28 defeats in 42 matches, and a 22 game streak without a clean sheet (22 September 1956 to 23 February 1957), and a losing streak of nine straight games (9 March 1957 to 20 April 1957). Everton won the League Championship, their first post-war title. Manchester United won the FA Cup, their first major trophy since the Munich Air Disaster in 1958. \n",

            "passage:  American diamond merchant Lucas Hill (Keanu Reeves) travels to Russia to sell rare blue diamonds to gangster Boris Volkov (Pasha D.Lychnikoff). However, his contact in St. Petersburg, Pyotr (Boris Gulyarin) who had the diamonds has gone missing. Boris threatens Lucas to deliver the diamonds in 48 hours. Russia established several consulates in the United States and Canada to cater to Russian immigrants. In 1917, the Tsarist government vanished. Consuls in seven U.S. cities and three Canadian cities maintained tsarist loyalties and received financing from the U.S. government. The consuls stopped their services in the late 1920s; the U.S. government seized the records of the consulates. The seizure started a long dispute. The National Archives and Records Administration received the documents in 1949. In 1980 the U.S. government loaned the documents of the Canadian consulates to the Library and Archives Canada. On 31 January 1990 the U.S. returned the documents to the Soviet Union and kept the microfilms as evidence. The movie opens in the tiny country of Pottsylvania, located between the countries WrestleMania and Yoursovania, where Fearless Leader concocts a plan to obtain a time-reversal microchip, invented by Professor Anton Paulovitch. He asks his top agent, Agent X (whose face is obscured), to do the assignment, but Agent X suggests they send some patsies to find Paulovitch. Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale accept their assignment to find the Professor, and are told to defect to America. After a number of failed attempts to get there (resulting in Fearless Leader having to save them many times), they make it to America, where they are sent to the CIA. The head of the CIA, Sheldon Kaufman, decides to have tests run on them to see if they are truly defecting. After the test, it's obvious to everyone that they should be deported, but a worker, Willie, points out they hadn't had any defections in a while, and thinks they should play along and in the meantime spy on them to see what they are after. While vacationing in Italy, a married American woman, Mary Forbes (Jennifer Jones), becomes entangled in an affair with Italian academic Giovanni Doria (Montgomery Clift). She decides to break off the affair and goes to Rome’s Stazione Termini to leave by train for Paris. As she says goodbye, he tries to make her stay and confesses his love for her. Together they wander the Termini station but ultimately she leaves him behind to go back to her husband. The Consulate-General of Russia in San Francisco was a diplomatic mission in the 2790 Green Street building in Pacific Heights, San Francisco. It was operated by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The building of the former consulate remains government property of Russia. A coded message is smuggled out of Russia, a plea for help from a supersecret laboratory deep in the frozen wastes of Siberia. The note is addressed to Johnny Porter, a Canadian Indian of the Gitxsan tribe with a genius for languages and disguises, and reluctantly he is forced to slip across the border on a rescue mission, the consequences of which he little imagines. The detailed picture of life in the Kolyma region and of the native peoples of the Russian Far East (such as the Evenks) and British Columbia (such as the Tsimshian) is impressive. Until a scale-back in Russian diplomatic presence in 2017, the Lothrop Mansion housed offices for the Russian Trade Representative.  Spaso House is a listed Neoclassical Revival building at No. 10 Spasopeskovskaya Square in Moscow. It was originally built in 1913 as the mansion of the textile industrialist Nikolay Vtorov. Since 1933, it has been the residence of the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and since 1991, to the Russian Federation. The building belonged to the USSR and later Russia and, under the 1985 Leasecontract, the U.S. was supposed to pay 72,500 Soviet roubles per year, which by 2001 was the equivalent of about $3, which the U.S. had failed to pay in 1993. In 2004, the two sides concluded a new 49-year lease that was said to be based on a joint assessment of the property's value; the rent rate was not disclosed. Andrew Carnegie purchased land between 90th and 91st Streets fronting on Fifth Avenue. The 1901 building of his mansion (which now houses the Cooper-Hewitt Museum), saw Carnegie purchasing neighbouring building lots in order to protect his investment. The entire north side of 91st Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues was also purchased by Carnegie. Carnegie sold off lots to individuals who agreed to build substantial dwellings, and in 1903 this home was built at 9 East 91st Street by John H. Hammond, a New York City banker. The land, and possibly the house, was a wedding gift to Hammond and his wife, Emily Vanderbilt Sloane, from Sloane's father, William J. Sloane of W. & J. Sloane. Built in 1910, to the designs of architects Nathan C. Wyeth and Francis P. Sullivan, the Beaux-Arts mansion is designated as a contributing property to the Sixteenth Street Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. In addition, the building is listed on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites. \n",

            "passage:  The Oakland Wye is an underground rapid transit flying wye junction in downtown Oakland, California which serves the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system. Trains can switch between (a) the northbound Richmond or Pittsburg/Bay Point lines (first station: 12th Street/Oakland City Center, underground), (b) the westbound San Francisco lines (first station: West Oakland, elevated), and (c) the southbound Fremont or Dublin/Pleasanton lines (first station: Lake Merritt, underground). The Oakland Wye has been described as one of the central and most complex parts of the BART system, and is a speed bottleneck for the whole system because the vast majority of BART trains pass through it. Sunday-only service to the station on the Dublin/Pleasanton line began as part of service changes effective February 11, 2019; on Sundays, the station serves as a transfer point between the Dublin/Pleasanton line and Transbay service. Sunday Dublin/Pleasanton service will be rerouted back to San Francisco on February 16, 2020. The $2.3-billion second phase, known as phase I of Silicon Valley BART Extension or the Berryessa extension, includes two new stations, the Milpitas and Berryessa/North San Jose stations. Both stations are expected to open sometime in 2020. The Berryessa extension broke ground in 2012, and was originally scheduled for completion in 2016.  The bookend from San Francisco to San Jose currently used by Caltrain is scheduled to be electrified by 2022. High-speed trains will run at on shared tracks beginning with the completed Phase 1 system in 2029. The one-way fare between San Francisco and San Jose is expected to cost $22 in 2013 dollars. The High Street Bridge is a double-leaf bascule drawbridge spanning 296 feet of the Oakland Estuary in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, United States. It links the cities of Oakland and Alameda. The bridge is opened approximately 1,400 times a year. The bridge carries an average of 26,000 vehicles per year. The bridge was built when the Oakland Estuary was trenched, converting Alameda from a peninsula to an island. Freeway ramps next to the tunnel provide access to Yerba Buena Island and Treasure Island. Because the toll plaza is on the Oakland side, the western span is a de facto non-tolled bridge; traffic between the island and the main part of San Francisco can freely cross back and forth. Those who only travel from Oakland to Yerba Buena Island, and not the entire length to the main part of San Francisco, must pay the full toll. In the United States, as used by the California Department of Transportation and in parts of Pennsylvania such as Harrisburg, Duncannon and Wyoming County, it can mean a depressed road undercrossing. The Caltrain Modernization Program (CalMod) is a $1.9 billion project that will add a positive train control (PTC) system and electrify the main line of the U.S. commuter railroad Caltrain, which serves cities in the San Francisco Peninsula and Silicon Valley, as well as transition from its current diesel-electric locomotive powered trains to electric multiple units (EMU). According to Caltrain, electrification of the tracks will allow it to improve service times via faster acceleration and shorter headways, reduce air pollution and noise, and facilitate a future railway tunnel into downtown San Francisco's Transbay Transit Center (as diesel trains cannot serve underground stations). California High-Speed Rail (abbreviated CAHSR or CHSR) is a publicly funded high-speed rail system under construction in the U.S. state of California. It is projected to connect the Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center in Anaheim and Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles with the Salesforce Transit Center in San Francisco via the Central Valley, providing a one-seat ride between Union Station and San Francisco in 2 hours and 40 minutes, a distance of . Future extensions are planned to connect to stations in San Diego County via the Inland Empire, as well as to Sacramento. The Park Street Bridge is a double-leaf bascule drawbridge spanning 372 feet of the Oakland Estuary in the San Francisco Bay Area. It links the cities of Oakland and Alameda. In a year, the bridge is opened approximately 1700 times and carries approximately 40,000 vehicles per work day. It was built when the Oakland Estuary was trenched, converting Alameda from a peninsula to an island. \n",

            "passage:  The Gold Line Foothill Extension is an extension of the Metro Gold Line light rail corridor from its former terminus in Pasadena, California, east through the \"Foothill Cities\" of Los Angeles County into San Bernardino County. The first stage of the plan, Phase 2A, extended the Gold Line from Pasadena to Azusa; it opened on March 5, 2016. Phase 2B, which will extend the line a further six stations to the Montclair Transcenter, broke ground in December 2017. The station serves the adjacent Chase Center arena, which opened on September 6, 2019. It was expanded to accommodate high ridership and increased service on game days. Initial plans in mid-2015 called for the northbound platform to be doubled in length to . Later that year, a variant design with a -long island platform south of South Street was proposed, which would allow two two-car trains in each direction to simultaneously serve the station. Construction of either design was expected to take 14 months and will include the installation of a crossover to allow trains to reverse direction at the station. In October 2015, the team, city, and UCSF reached a preliminary agreement under which the city and UCSF supported the construction of the arena, in exchange for a package of transportation improvements which include the expanded station and the purchase of four additional light rail vehicles. Chase Center is a multi-purpose arena under construction in the Mission Bay neighborhood of San Francisco that will open before the 2019–20 NBA season. Groundbreaking of the arena happened during the 2016–17 NBA season. It will mainly be used for basketball, becoming the new home of the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Warriors, who have been located in the San Francisco Bay Area since 1962, have played their home games at Oracle Arena in Oakland since 1971. The $2.3-billion second phase, known as phase I of Silicon Valley BART Extension or the Berryessa extension, includes two new stations, the Milpitas and Berryessa/North San Jose stations. Both stations are expected to open sometime in 2020. The Berryessa extension broke ground in 2012, and was originally scheduled for completion in 2016.  Established in 1975, the museum was previously located in San Francisco and until recently was situated at the Hunters Point Shipyard. In 2007 the museum moved its collection of 12 locomotives and over 25 pieces of rolling stock to home of the Niles Canyon Railway in Sunol, California. As of 2019, another move is being planned, this time to Schellville, California, on the Northwestern Pacific Railroad. The museum performs restoration work on its collection, which it showcases for special events. Oakley is a planned station that will be a stop on Amtrak California's \"San Joaquin\" service. The station was partially funded by a 2018 grant from California's Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program. Construction is expected to be completed by the end of 2020. The construction of a $1 billion office, residential, and entertainment development spearheaded by Verizon Wireless, which has an office campus across the street, prompted DART to resume plans for the station's construction. On April 24, 2019, DART announced that its board had officially approved the renaming of Carpenter Ranch Station to Hidden Ridge Station to tie in with the adjacent project. Construction was set to begin in summer 2019, with revenue service planned to begin in May 2020. Valley Metro Rail opened its initial starter line on December 27, 2008. The starter line, which was funded through a combination of federal, regional and local municipal funds, operated from the 19th Avenue/Montebello station in Phoenix, through Tempe, serving the Arizona State University Tempe campus, and ended at the Sycamore/Main Street station in Mesa.

By the end of April 1997, he had won three PGA Tour events in addition to his first major, the 1997 Masters. Woods won this tournament by 12 strokes in a record-breaking performance and earned $486,000. He first reached the number one position in the world rankings in June 1997, less than a year after turning pro. Throughout the 2000s, Woods was the dominant force in golf—he won the 2000 U.S. Open by a record 15-shot margin. He was the top-ranked golfer in the world from August 1999 to September 2004 (264 weeks) and again from June 2005 to October 2010 (281 weeks). Martin Adams attempted to defend the title that he won at the 14th attempt in 2007 but he lost in the Semi-Finals to Mark Webster. Webster won the World Championship, beating Simon Whitlock 7–5 in the final. Mark Selby won the tournament on his first attempt by defeating Stephen Lee 10–3 in the final. In the final frame, he tied Ken Doherty for the highest break of the tournament, recording a total clearance of 141. The 2008 Players Championship was a golf tournament in Florida on the PGA Tour, held at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, southeast of Jacksonville.

The 2008 Open Championship was a men's major golf championship and the 137th Open Championship, played from 17–20 July at Royal Birkdale Golf Club in Southport, England. Pádraig Harrington successfully defended his Open Championship title, his second; he shot four under par over the final nine holes and was four strokes ahead of runner-up Ian Poulter. Harrington was the last golfer to win the same major back-to-back for a decade until Brooks Koepka won consecutive U.S. Opens in 2017 and 2018. The 2008 Masters Tournament was the 72nd Masters Tournament, held April 10–13 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. Trevor Immelman won his first major title, three strokes ahead of runner-up Tiger Woods, a four-time champion. Immelman led or tied for the lead after every round. The purse remained at $8,000,000, one of the largest in golf. Tiger Woods won his third WGC Match Play title, and his 15th World Golf Championships event, by beating fellow American Stewart Cink 8 and 7 in the final. The 1988 Open Championship was a men's major golf championship and the 117th Open Championship, held from 14–18 July at the Royal Lytham & St Annes Golf Club in Lytham St Annes, England. In a first-ever Monday finish, Seve Ballesteros shot a final round 65 to capture his third Open Championship and fifth major title, two strokes ahead of runner-up Nick Price, the 54-hole leader. Twenty-one of the tournament's 48 competitors were currently on the 2008/09 main tour of the more established 15-reds game, including former world champions Peter Ebdon and Ken Doherty, 2007 finalist Mark Selby and the hugely successful Jimmy White.

The Western Allies organized the Berlin airlift (26 June 1948–30 September 1949) to carry supplies to the people of West Berlin, a difficult feat given the size of the city's population. Aircrews from the United States Air Force, the Royal Air Force, the French Air Force, the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Royal Australian Air Force, the Royal New Zealand Air Force, and the South African Air Force:338 flew over 200,000 sorties in one year,  providing to the West Berliners up to 12,941 tons of necessities in a day, such as fuel and food, with the original plan being to lift 3,475 tons of supplies however by the end of the airlift that number was often met twofold. The Soviets did not disrupt the airlift for fear this might lead to open conflict, even though they far outnumbered the allies in Germany and especially Berlin. <ref>Tusa, Ann, and John Tusa.

The 2017–2018 Iranian protests refer to a series of public protests occurring in various cities throughout Iran beginning on 28 December 2017 and continuing into 2018. The first protest took place in Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city by population, initially focused on the economic policies of the country's government; however, as protests spread throughout the country, their scope expanded to include political opposition to the theocratic regime of Iran and its longtime Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei. The wave of protests that swept across the nation sent a strong message to international onlookers. It exposed the regime's vulnerabilities and shortcomings and showed that the Iranian people are ready for regime change. The Iranian public has showcased their fury with a wide repertoire of chants aimed at the regime and its leadership. According to \"The Washington Post,\" protesters' chants and attacks on government buildings upended a system that had little tolerance for dissent, with some demonstrators even shouting \"Death to the dictator!\"—referring to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei—and asking security forces to join them. A previous bombing on May 31, 2017 killed over 150 and injured over 463, targeting the German embassy. This led to concerns over security, eventually culminating in a protest on June 2.

The Rieti Meeting was originally scheduled for 3 September, but the meeting folded due to financial issues. The bear has come to be used as the mascot of Berlin, and was used almost excessively by local authorities, so that Hans Brendicke, editor of the journal of the Historical Society of Berlin, in 1896 remarked on the ubiquity of badly designed bears in Berlin. A member of the Historical Society went on to collect a total of 273 different representations of bears in Berlin. Hildebrandt in 1915 again complained about the excesses of variation in the bear, especially deviation from the Prussian tincture of black on white. On 29 January 2019, French urban climber Alain Robert climbed the building and was arrested upon finishing his descent. The event is the brainchild of the former GAISF President, the late Patick Baumann. Although Baumann's death occurred before the first games, the project was maintained by the new executive of GAISF, and finally announced in 2018, with the first two editions originally awarded to Los Angeles, California. Disagreement over the program led to the venue of the first two editions being changed to Budapest, Hungary. The Games are designed as a showcase for new, urban sports and lifestyle.

            "passage:  In 2016, the team announced that they would field the No. 07 full-time for Ray Black Jr. with sponsorship from Scubalife.com in all the races. He picked up 9 top-20 finishes, with a best finish of 14th in Bristol (August). He finished 19th in the driver standings. Black returned to the No. 07 for 2017, but was replaced with Todd Bodine for Charlotte. It was later announced that Spencer Boyd and Andy Lally would drive at Pocono and Mid-Ohio respectively. It was announced that Black would drive full-time in the 07 in 2019. For the 2004 season, a shuffling of the NASCAR schedule saw the race move to November. Track management believed the November date would allow for cooler, more comfortable weather for fans, who had increasingly voiced concerns about the hot, humid, weather. In addition, it meant the race would be part of the new Chase for the Nextel Cup. Rockingham lost its fall date to Fontana, and the Pop Secret 500 was moved to the prestigious Labor Day weekend date. Bella, who first appears in Twilight, is a 17-year-old girl, who moves out from her mother's home in Phoenix, Arizona, to live with her father, Charlie Swan, a police chief, in her birthplace of Forks, Washington. There, she is enrolled at Forks High School, where she becomes intrigued by a student, Edward Cullen. When Edward saves her life, he exhibits super-human qualities. Bella learns from her family friend Jacob Black that Quileute legends say the Cullen family are actually vampires. Edward eventually admits to this truth, though his family hunts only animals, not humans, through moral choice. Edward constantly warns Bella against being with him, perceiving her life to be at constant risk if she continues to associate with him, because the scent of her blood is more powerful to him than that of any other human he has ever met. Bella's love and confidence in Edward's restraint is such that his warnings go unheeded, and on an outing with the rest of the Cullen family, she becomes the target of a sadistic vampire, James. With his family's help, Edward is able to save Bella from James' predations, though Edward is still unwilling to change Bella into a vampire himself. The first car named \"City of Industry\" was a Cadillac-powered 1953 Kurtis. It won the NHRA national titles in A/SP (A Production) at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in 1958 (with a pass of 12.17 seconds at ), AM/SP (A Modified Production) at Detroit Dragway in 1960 (with a pass of 12.29 seconds at ), and at Indianapolis Raceway Park in 1961 (with a pass of 11.91 seconds at ) and 1962 (with a pass of 12.53 seconds at ). The game is set in the Cars world of Radiator Springs, and the game about the first ever Mater-National race, held in Radiator Springs by Lightning McQueen. There are some new characters that are in the game. The game features different-looking playing areas, and Radiator Springs, Ornament Valley, and Tailfin Pass have all been updated. In Radiator Springs, new roads have been added. In Ornament Valley, an airport and several new rock formations have been added. In Tailfin Pass, the roads have been completely revamped. In all three playing areas, some of the roads have been blocked off and can only be played in races. The 2015 race was extended due to a green-white-checker finish, and saw the most cautions issued. The race was acquired as a result of the Ferko lawsuit, which forced NASCAR to relinquish the sport's fourth major, the Mountain Dew Southern 500 and in the process end its Grand Slam, as the Southern 500 was one of the four races that made it up. This race has been derisively referred to as the Francis Ferko 500, mostly by traditionalist fans upset by the demise of the Southern 500. Until the 2004 Nextel Cup season, two annual races were held at Rockingham. After the 2003 season, the fall race (the Pop Secret Microwave Popcorn 400) — which was held in November — was moved to California Speedway, to be held on the lucrative Labor Day weekend. This displaced the Mountain Dew Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway, which moved to November 2004 before being removed from the schedule completely (replaced by a second date at Texas Motor Speedway). The changes were part of the trend of less races being held in the southeast and a broader distribution across the United States. Though the spring date was not directly transferred to California, NASCAR moved up the first California race to the traditional spring Rockingham date the week after Daytona. This resulted in some criticism because teams had to travel cross-country for the second race as most spend two weeks in Daytona and are based in the Charlotte, North Carolina area. The draw for Rockingham was that teams got to stay close to home right after Daytona before traveling for the next race. While en route to Wal-Mart for grass seed, Ray and Mary Burkett, with their dog Biznezz in the back seat, fight about the state of their lawn, his smoking, and her obesity. Mary demands they stop at a convenience store in order to purchase a purple kickball for their niece's birthday, and while in there she suffers a heart attack and immediately dies. Her husband Ray is fetched from the car by a store employee. The emergency medical technicians arrive, pronounce her dead, and remove her body. Ray remains with the store employees and customers, recounting Mary's County Fair awards for her quilting. After nearly two hours have passed, he returns to the car, where Biznezz has died from hyperthermia, with the remnants of a Sno Ball Ray had fed him earlier still in his whiskers. This causes in Ray a simultaneous welling-up of \"great sadness\" and \"amusement\". The story is written in third-person limited narrative and reveals a number of Ray's more egocentric thoughts throughout the story's events, such as being disturbed at the similarity between the manager's attempts at mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and French kissing, the thought that a bystander might give him a mercy fuck, and, as the story closes, the thought that he can now smoke whatever, whenever, and wherever he likes. The theory was proposed following reductions, which have now been observed in Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Iceland, Japan (early 1990s), New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom (many cities from about 1994) and the United States.  \n",

Their home ground is Westpac Stadium, which is located on Wellington's waterfront, and holds approximately 36,000 spectators. The Wellington Phoenix is also the longest running New Zealand professional football club, surpassing the now defunct Football Kingz FC. The LA Xtreme were the only champions of the XFL because NBC dropped the XFL concept after the first season due to dismal ratings. Shortly after this, McMahon announced that the league would be dissolved. However, the Xtreme's quarterback, Tommy Maddox, subsequently caught on with the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League, later leading them into the playoffs in 2002 and winning a Super Bowl Ring in 2005. Maddox also won the XFL's Most Valuable Player award. Jeremaine Copeland has achieved success in the CFL with the Montreal Alouettes, the Calgary Stampeders, and the Toronto Argonauts winning two Grey Cup championships. Super League XIX will be the third and final year of a licensed Super League. Under this system, promotion and relegation between Super League and Championship was abolished, and 14 teams were granted licences subject to certain criteria. For the 2014 season, all fourteen teams from the previous season will compete, although Salford have changed their names from the City Reds to the Red Devils. Prior to this World Bowl, the Dragons won the regular season series against the Thunder, 21–14 on the road and 55–35 at home. Super League XXI commenced on 4 February 2016 and ended on 8 October with the Super League Grand Final. It consisted of 23 regular season games, 9 rounds of relevant play-offs which included the Grand Final.

            "passage:  The NHL Entry Draft is held each June, allowing teams to select players who have turned 18 years old by September 15 in the year the draft is held. The draft order is determined by the previous season's order of finish, with non-playoff teams drafting first, followed by the teams that made the playoffs, with the specific order determined by the number of points earned by each team. The NHL holds a weighted lottery for the 14 non-playoff teams, allowing the winner to move up to the first overall pick. The team with the fewest points has the best chance of winning the lottery, with each successive team given a lower chance of moving up in the draft. Between 1986 and 1994, the NHL also held a Supplemental Draft for players in American colleges. Detroit's first draft pick was Peter Mahovlich, taken second overall in the 1963 NHL Amateur Draft. The Red Wings have chosen first overall three times, selecting Claude Gauthier in 1964, Dale McCourt in 1977, and Joe Murphy in 1986. McCourt and Murphy both spent some time in the NHL with Detroit, but Gauthier never played in the league. Twelve picks went on to play over 1,000 NHL games, while two of these, Nicklas Lidström and Steve Yzerman, played in over 1,500 games, both spending their entire NHL careers in Detroit. The 1995 NHL Entry Draft was held at Edmonton Coliseum in Edmonton, Alberta. The drafting order was now set partially by a lottery system whereby teams would not be guaranteed first pick if they finished last. Instead, a draft lottery was instituted in which the winner of the lottery could move up a maximum of four spots in the first-round draft order, meaning only the five worst teams, based on regular season points in a given season, could pick first in the draft, and no team in the non-playoff group could move down more than one place. The Los Angeles Kings won the lottery, and thus moved up four spots from seventh to third. The last-place finishers, the Ottawa Senators did not lose the first overall pick through the lottery and picked Bryan Berard. As of the 2019 NHL Entry Draft, the Flyers have selected 62 goaltenders and 430 skaters (forwards and defensemen) in the NHL Entry Draft since their first draft in 1967. They selected an additional 3 goaltenders and 7 skaters from 1986 to 1994 in the short-lived NHL Supplemental Draft, which was for selecting collegiate players who were not eligible for the standard Entry Draft. As of the completion of the 2018–19 season, 197 Flyers draft picks have appeared in at least one NHL game. The NHL Entry Draft is held each June, allowing teams to select players who have turned 18 years old by September 15 in the year the draft is held. The draft order is determined by the previous season's order of finish, with non-playoff teams drafting first, followed by the teams that made the playoffs, with the specific order determined by the number of points earned by each team. Since 2016, the NHL holds a weighted lottery for the 15 non-playoff teams, allowing the winners to move up to the top three selections. From 1995–2012 the winner of the draft lottery was allowed to move up a maximum of four positions in the entry draft. The team with the fewest points has the best chance of winning the lottery, with each successive team given a lower chance of moving up in the draft. The Oilers have won the lottery three times, in 2010, 2012 and 2015. Between 1986 and 1994, the NHL also held a Supplemental Draft for players in American colleges. The NHL Entry Draft eligibility requires players to have turned 18 years old by September 15 in the year the draft is held, excluding players older than 20 years old before December 31 of that same year, the latter not applying to non-North American players. The draft order is determined by the previous season's order of finish: non-playoff teams draft first in order of placement in the standings, followed by teams that competed in the post-season whose order is determined by the Stanley Cup playoffs results. Once the regular season is over, a weighted lottery is held for the 14 teams who miss the playoffs, giving teams the opportunity to move up to a higher pick including the first overall selection. From 1995 to 2012, a team that won the lottery could only move up a maximum of four picks, preventing some teams from winning the top selection regardless of winning the lottery. During that time, the Islanders won the lottery twice, receiving the top selection both times (2000 and 2009). The team finished last in the league standings in the 2000–01 season, but picked second in the draft after the Atlanta Thrashers won the lottery. The NHL Entry Draft is held each June, allowing teams to select players who have turned 18 years old by September 15 in the year the draft is held. The draft order is determined by the previous season's order of finish, with non-playoff teams drafting first, followed by the teams that made the playoffs, with the specific order determined by the number of points earned by each team. The NHL holds a weighted lottery for the 14 non-playoff teams, the winner of the lottery will pick first overall as of 2013. Prior to 2013, the winning team could only move up a maximum of four positions in the entry draft. The team with the fewest points has the best chance of winning the lottery, with each successive team given a lower chance of moving up in the draft. The Kings have won the lottery once in 1995 – the team moved up from the seventh pick overall to the third pick, which they used to select Aki Berg. Between 1986 and 1994, the NHL also held a Supplemental Draft for players in American colleges. The 1974–75 Buffalo Sabres season was the Sabres' fifth season in the National Hockey League (NHL). The Sabres finished in a tie for the best record in the NHL in the 1974–75 regular season after a disappointing 1974 that saw the 1973–74 team fail to return to the NHL playoffs as they had the year before. Buffalo advanced to the Stanley Cup finals for the first time in team history to play against the rough Philadelphia Flyers (who had been recently nicknamed the \"Broad Street Bullies\"), a series which included the legendary Fog Game (game three of the series).  The Sabres lost the series 4–2. The 1974–75 Philadelphia Flyers season was the Philadelphia Flyers eighth season in the National Hockey League (NHL). The Flyers repeated as Stanley Cup champions. The 1974–75 Flyers were the last Stanley Cup champion to be composed entirely of Canadian-born players. The NHL Entry Draft is held each June, allowing teams to select players who have turned 18 years old by September 15 in the year the draft is held. The draft order is determined by the previous season's order of finish, with non-playoff teams drafting first, followed by the teams that made the playoffs, with the specific order determined by the number of points earned by each team. Since 2016, the NHL holds a weighted lottery for the 15 non-playoff teams, allowing the winners to move up to the top three selections. From 1995–2012 the winner of the draft lottery was allowed to move up a maximum of four positions in the entry draft. The team with the fewest points has the best chance of winning the lottery, with each successive team given a lower chance of moving up in the draft. The Flames have never won the lottery. Between 1986 and 1994, the NHL also held a Supplemental Draft for players in American colleges. The first draft was held in 1963, and has been held every year since. The NHL Entry Draft was known as the NHL Amateur Draft until 1979. The entry draft has only been a public event since 1980, and a televised event since 1984. Up to 1994, the order was solely determined by the standings at the end of the regular season. In 1995, the NHL Draft Lottery was introduced where only teams who had missed the playoffs could participate. The lottery winner moved up the draft order a maximum of four places, meaning only the five worst teams, based on regular season points in a given season, could pick first in the draft, and no team in the non-playoff group could move down more than one place. The chances of winning the lottery were weighted towards the teams at the bottom of the regular season standings. Beginning in 2013, the limit of moving up a maximum of four places in the draft order was eliminated, so the lottery winner would automatically receive the first overall pick, and any teams above it in the draft order would still move down one spot. \n",

            "passage:  The six new teams were the Los Angeles Kings, Minnesota North Stars, Oakland Seals, Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and St. Louis Blues. This expansion, including placing two new clubs on the West Coast, was the result of the league's fears of a rival league that would challenge the NHL for players and the Stanley Cup. In addition, the league hoped that the expansion would result in a lucrative TV contract in the United States. The 1991 NHL Entry Draft was held on June 22 at the Memorial Auditorium in Buffalo, New York. A total of 264 players were drafted. The worst team in the previous 1990–91 season, the Quebec Nordiques, was given the first overall pick while the expansion San Jose Sharks held the second overall pick. The Sabres, along with the Vancouver Canucks, joined the NHL in the 1970–71 season. Their first owners were Seymour H. Knox III and Northrup Knox, scions of a family long prominent in Western New York and grandsons of the co-founders of the Woolworth's variety store chain; along with Robert O. Swados, a Buffalo attorney. On the team's inaugural board of directors were Robert E. Rich, Jr., later the owner of the Buffalo Bisons minor league baseball team; and George W. Strawbridge, Jr., an heir to the Campbell Soup Company fortune. Buffalo had a history of professional hockey; immediately prior to the Sabres' establishment, the Buffalo Bisons were a pillar of the American Hockey League (AHL), having existed since 1940 (and before that, another Bisons hockey team played from 1928 to 1936), winning the Calder Cup in their final season. The 1967 NHL Expansion Draft was held on June 6, 1967, in the ballroom of the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, Quebec. The draft took place to fill the rosters of the league's six expansion teams for the 1967–68 season: the California Seals, Los Angeles Kings, Minnesota North Stars, Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins and the St. Louis Blues. The 1991 NHL Dispersal and Expansion Drafts were held via telephone conference call on May 30, 1991. The dispersal draft took place to fill the roster of the league's only expansion team for the 1991–92 season, the San Jose Sharks, first from the Minnesota North Stars pool of players, and then from the rest of the NHL pool of players (to re-stock the North Stars' roster and to fill out the Sharks' roster). 21 of the 22 franchises in the league at the time of the draft were allowed to protect two goaltenders and fourteen position players (the San Jose Sharks was the only team exempt of protection restrictions as they were an expansion team the previous season). Beyond that, every team had to make available at least one goaltender who had played at least one NHL game. The 1995 NBA Expansion Draft was the tenth expansion draft in the history of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The draft was held on June 24, 1995, so that the newly founded Toronto Raptors and Vancouver Grizzlies could acquire players for the upcoming . Toronto was awarded an expansion team on September 30, 1993, while Vancouver was awarded the league's 29th franchise on April 27, 1994. They were the first NBA teams based in Canada since the Toronto Huskies. The 1993 NHL Expansion Draft was held on June 24, 1993, in Quebec City, Quebec. The draft took place to fill the rosters of the league's two expansion teams for the 1993–94 season, the Florida Panthers and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The 24 teams existing in the league at the time of the draft were each allowed to protect one goaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards. All first-year pros were exempt from claim, and all second-year pros on the reserve list were exempt from claim. The 1992 NHL Expansion Draft was held on June 18, 1992. The draft took place to fill the rosters of the league's two expansion teams for the 1992–93 season, the Ottawa Senators and the Tampa Bay Lightning. \n",

            "passage:  José María López Lledín was an elegant vagabond known as El Caballero de París (\"The Gentleman From Paris\") who wandered the streets of Havana and was a well-known cult figure in the Cuban Capital. El Caballero de París is portrayed in a bronze statue by José Villa Soberón.  The Balbo Monument consists of a column that is approximately 2,000 years old dating from between 117 and 38 BC and a contemporary stone base. It was taken from an ancient port town outside of Rome by Benito Mussolini and gifted to the city of Chicago in 1933 to honor the trans-Atlantic flight led by Italo Balbo to the Century of Progress Worlds Fair. Youssef Gergi Abed (1911 – December 2006), also known as Pépé Abed, was a Lebanese adventurer, explorer and entrepreneur. He is considered the epitome of Lebanon's golden age. Nicknamed 'The Hugh Hefner of the Middle East', he was frequently linked with a series of beauty icons from around the world. \"Cafundó\" is a biopic of miracle worker \"preto velho\" João de Camargo of Sorocaba and is based on the book \"João de Camargo de Sorocaba: O Nascimento de uma Religião\" by Carlos de Campos and Adolfo Frioli. The title comes from a former \"quilombo\", the source of João de Camargo's original spiritual inspiration, located in today's Salto de Pirapora. The City Mayors Foundation commissions the trophy presented as the World Mayor Award. The trophy was designed by artist Manuel Ferrari and is handmade out of steel by the metalworker Kaspar Swankey. In 1975, Airaudi and a group of about 25 other people founded the Federation of Damanhur, a New Age commune and eco-village. Beginning in 1978, Airaudi directed construction of the underground facility the Temples of Humankind. Initially in secret, the Temples become public knowledge in 1992, when a former member sued to regain his possessions from the group. Prior to founding the community, he had worked as an insurance agent. The monument was commissioned by Emperor Napoleon III from the sculptor Aimé Millet and installed in 1865 on Mont Auxois, near Alise-Sainte-Reine in the Côte-d'Or department in the Burgundy region of eastern France. The site was the supposed site of Alesia. Napoleon III erected the seven-meter-tall statue to commemorate Vercingetorix as a symbol of Gallic nationalism. The architect for the memorial was Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. The base has an nationalistic inscription installed by Viollet-le-Duc, translating into French the words of Julius Caesar: When an explorer and world famous cartographer by the name of Adrien Blake returns from an expedition he discovers that his fiancée, Sophia has disappeared. Wrought with grief Adrian immerses himself in his manuscripts and reveals an ancient curse placed on him by the goddess Ishtar. Blake must go to 79AD Pompei, where a volcano will erupt in four days time, destroying the city, and find Sophia. Giro del Sole is a 20th-century, life-size bronze statuary complex, designed by Roberto Barni, located at ground level in piazza dell’Ortaggio, in Pistoia, region of Tuscany, Italy. The monument, installed in 1996, consists of three blindfolded individual men, walking forward in a radially divergent and centrifugal directions. Each is holding what is described as an oil lantern. At their feet are symbols of a sun, moon, and star. The complex does not appear to allude directly to any historical event, but appears to be a cryptic symbol of the human condition: blindfolded men holding a lamp, striding in divergent directions. Some claim that there may be an allusion to Diogenes, walking in the daylight with a lamp, searching for an honest man. Antoine Laumet de la Mothe, sieur de Cadillac (/ˈkædɪlæk/, French: [kadijak]; March 5, 1658 – October 16, 1730), usually referred to as Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac (also spelled Motte), was a French explorer and adventurer in New France which stretched from Eastern Canada to Louisiana on the Gulf of Mexico. He rose from a modest beginning in Acadia in 1683 as an explorer, trapper, and a trader of alcohol and furs, and he achieved various positions of political importance in the colony. He was the commander of Fort de Buade in St. Ignace, Michigan in 1694. In 1701, he founded Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit which became the city of Detroit, which he commanded until 1710. Between 1710 and 1716, he was the governor of Louisiana, although he did not arrive in that territory until 1713. \n",

            "passage:  Rory McIlroy (born 4 May 1989) is a professional golfer from Northern Ireland who is a member of both the European and PGA Tours. He was world number one in the Official World Golf Ranking for 95 weeks. He is a four-time major champion, winning the 2011 U.S Open and setting the then tournament record score of −16 (since equalled), 2012 PGA Championship (with a tournament record margin of victory (8 strokes)), 2014 Open Championship, and 2014 PGA Championship. Along with Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, and Jordan Spieth, he is one of four players to win three majors by the age of 25. The event was first held in 1991 with 16 players aged over 40. It took place at the Trentham Gardens in Stoke-on-Trent with the sponsorship of Matchroom. The final was contested between the two highest ranked players, with Cliff Wilson defeating Eddie Charlton 5–4 to become the inaugural champion. The event was revived in 2010, but the field was reduced to 9 players and was played in Bradford. The event was sponsored by Wyldecrest Park Homes, who remained the sponsor until 2012. The tournament was not held from 2009 to 2014 but returned to the schedule in 2015. The 2015 event was held at Woburn and was won by Matthew Fitzpatrick. Alex Norén won in 2016 at The Grove while Paul Dunne won in 2017 at Close House Golf Club with a record score of 260. Tiger Woods won his fifth Green Jacket, and fifteenth major, by one stroke ahead of three runners-up. It left him one shy of Jack Nicklaus' record six Masters win, and three short of his record eighteen major wins. At age 43 he became the second oldest winner, again only bettered by Nicklaus who won at age 46. It was 11 years after his last major win, the 2008 U.S. Open, and 14 years since his last Masters win beating the previous record of 13 years held by Gary Player. Due to the high profile of Woods, and his storied fall from the top of the game due to personal issues and injuries, the victory generated a large amount of publicity around the world, and is regarded as one of the great sporting comebacks. At the time, many (including noted commentator Gary McCord) predicted the start of a long rivalry between Woods and García. The teenage García's outgoing antics during the tournament had captured the attention of many golf fans, but his sole major title came over seventeen years later at the Masters in 2017. Mike Weir, the co-leader with Woods after 54 holes, shot 80 in the final round and tied for tenth. Defending champion Craig Stadler was tied for the 54-hole lead with 1976 champion Raymond Floyd, with Ballesteros one stroke back, and two-time champion Tom Watson an additional stroke behind. Ballesteros got off to a fast start in the final round on Monday with a birdie-eagle start. With another birdie at the difficult par-3 fourth, he added four pars and another birdie at the ninth for a five-under 31 on the front nine. Ballesteros cruised to a 69 (−3) and a comfortable win as neither Stadler, Floyd, nor Watson broke par. This is a list of all the International team golfers who have played in the Presidents Cup through 2019. The International Team represents the rest of the world excluding the United States (the opponents) and Europe (which plays the United States in the Ryder Cup). Adam Scott holds the record number of appearances with nine. Ernie Els holds the record for most points with 21. Anthony Jacklin CBE (born 7 July 1944) is a retired English golfer. He was the most successful British player of his generation, winning two major championships, the 1969 Open Championship and the 1970 U.S. Open. He was also Ryder Cup captain from 1983 to 1989; Europe winning two and tying another of these four events. Tiger Woods won his first major championship, twelve strokes ahead of runner-up Tom Kite. Through 2019, the margin of victory and four-day score of 270 (−18) are tournament records. Woods also became both the youngest (21) and the first non-white player to win at  Jack Nicklaus holds the record for the most Masters victories, winning the tournament six times during his career. Nicklaus is also the oldest winner of the Masters: he was 46 years 82 days old when he won in 1986. Nicklaus, Nick Faldo, and Tiger Woods co-hold the record for most consecutive victories with two. Woods was the youngest winner of the Masters, 21 years 104 days old when he won in 1997. Woods also set the record for the widest winning margin (12 strokes), and the lowest winning score, with 270, 18 below par (-18) in 1997. The latter was equaled by Jordan Spieth in 2015. \n",

            "passage:  In late 2015, the band auctioned the signature 'Fenix' inflatable and backdrop amongst various props and costumes to raise funds for the November 2015 Paris attacks. When a Norwegian couple are instructed by a policeman to take a detour through the Swedish forests, a series of strange and horrifying events follow. In 2014, plans were drawn up to allow the festival to be relocated to Strathallan Castle. This was due to a section of the festival grounds at Balado being situated over the Forties pipeline causing the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to request for the festival to be relocated away from its previous site at Balado. According to HSE, an accident could result in \"a large number of casualties\" and people receiving \"a dangerous dose of thermal radiation.\" The 2015 event resulted in the traffic chaos, with claims of up to five hour delays, which were partly blamed on the wet conditions which resulted in tractors hauling hundreds of vehicles onto the exit road People taking to Social media The film begins in the town of Hudson, Ohio, where Scott \"Scotty\" Thomas is dumped by his girlfriend, Fiona, immediately after his high school graduation in 2004. With his best friend, Cooper Harris, Scotty attends a graduation party that evening where the band performs a song detailing the affair Fiona was having with the band's singer.  The full English title refers to the setting of the film and the time of day at which Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu fled following the revolution, 12:08 pm on 22 December 1989. The original Romanian title roughly translates to \"Was There or Wasn't There?\", referring to the film's central issue: did Vaslui have any part in the 1989 revolution? The answer depends on whether the city registered any protest before the moment of Ceauşescu's flight. Arde Lucus (also written as \"Arde Lvcvs\")(Burn Lugo) is a festival celebrated in Lugo in the last weeks of June which revives the Roman and castro past of the city, and which emerged to commemorate the declaration of the city's Roman wall as a World Heritage Site in 2000. In its latest editions it has reached nearly half a million visitors. The film, like several of its predecessors, was intended to be the final film in the series. Filming took place primarily in Vancouver, British Columbia, with additional photography in New York City's Times Square and in Los Angeles. At the time of its production, \"Jason Takes Manhattan\" was the most expensive film in the series, with a budget of around $5 million. It received substantial attention for its initial marketing campaign, featuring Jason Voorhees slashing through the \"I Love New York\" logo with a knife, which was later retracted after the New York City Tourism committee filed a complaint against Paramount Pictures. The West Pier Trust now owns the pier and has proposed various plans to renovate it. Some schemes have been opposed by local residents and the owners of the nearby Palace Pier, who have claimed unfair competition. The pier gradually collapsed during the early 21st century. Major sections collapsed in late 2002, and two fires in March and May 2003 left little of the original structure. Subsequently, English Heritage declared it to be beyond repair. Structured demolition took place in 2010 to make way for the observation tower i360; further structural damage from storms has occurred since. In 2014, plans were drawn up to allow the festival to be relocated to Strathallan Castle. This was due to a section of the festival grounds at Balado being situated over the Forties pipeline causing the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to request for the festival to be relocated away from its previous site at Balado.

            "passage:  Boys for Pele is the third studio album by American singer and songwriter Tori Amos. Preceded by the first single, \"Caught a Lite Sneeze\", by three weeks, the album was released on January 22, 1996, in the United Kingdom, on January 23 in the United States, and on January 29 in Australia. Despite the album being Amos's least accessible radio material to date, \"Boys for Pele\" debuted at number two on both the US \"Billboard\" 200 and the UK Albums Chart, making it her biggest simultaneous transatlantic debut, her first \"Billboard\" top 10 debut, and the highest-charting US debut of her career to date. Pindrop is the debut studio album by English post-punk band The Passage, released in 1980 by record label Object. MAM Records was a British record label launched in 1970 by the management company Management Agency & Music Ltd. (MAM). It was founded by Gordon Mills and Tom Jones and distributed by Decca Records. The first single released on MAM was \"I Hear You Knocking\" by Dave Edmunds in 1970. Later that year, Gilbert O'Sullivan started his run of hit singles on MAM with \"Nothing Rhymed\", and he also provided MAM with its first hit album in 1971 with \"Himself\". Other hit albums such as \"Back to Front\", \"I'm a Writer, Not a Fighter\", and \"A Stranger In My Own Back Yard\" followed.  What's a Few Men? is the fifth studio album by Australian rock band Hunters & Collectors, which was released on 16 November 1987. The album's title was drawn from Albert Facey's memoir \"A Fortunate Life\". The album peaked at No. 16 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart and No. 9 on the New Zealand Albums Chart. It provided the singles, \"Do You See What I See\", issued in October 1987 and \"Still Hangin' Round\", in February the following year. \"Do You See What I See\" reached No. 33 in Australia while in New Zealand it became their highest charting single at No. 13. \"Losing My Religion\" is a song by the American alternative rock band R.E.M. The song was released as the first single from the group's 1991 album Out of Time. Built on a mandolin riff, \"Losing My Religion\" was an unlikely hit for the group, garnering heavy airplay on radio as well as on MTV due to its critically acclaimed music video. The song became R.E.M.'s highest-charting hit in the United States, reaching No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and expanding the group's popularity beyond its original fanbase. It was nominated for several Grammy Awards, and won two for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Short Form Music Video. Prelude to History is the second and final studio album by German girl group Preluders. It was released on September 27, 2004 by Cheyenne Records, Polydor and Zeitgeist. A collection of cover versions of songs from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, it features production by Thorsten Brötzmann, Andre \"Brix\" Buchmann, and Ingo Politz. Upon its release, the album underperformed, debuting and peaking at number 44 on the German Albums Chart. It spawned two moderately successful singles with \"Walking on Sunshine\" and a remake of The Contours' \"Do You Love Me\", resulting in lackluster sales in general. Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret is the debut studio album by English synth-pop duo Soft Cell. It was released in the United Kingdom on 27 November 1981 by Some Bizzare Records. The album's critical and commercial success was bolstered by the success of its lead single, a cover version of Gloria Jones's song \"Tainted Love\", which topped the charts worldwide and became the best-selling British single of 1981 in the United States—as a result of the single's success, the album had reported advance orders of more than 200,000 copies. The album spawned two additional top-five singles in the UK: \"Bedsitter\" and \"Say Hello, Wave Goodbye\". Out of Time is the seventh studio album by American alternative rock band R.E.M., released on March 12, 1991 by Warner Bros. Records. With Out of Time, R.E.M.'s status grew from that of a cult band to a massive international act. The record topped the album sales charts in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom, spending 109 weeks on American album charts and enjoying two separate spells at the summit, and spending 183 weeks on the British charts and a single week at the top. The album has sold over four and a half million copies in the U.S. and over 18 million copies worldwide. The album won three Grammy Awards in 1992: one as Best Alternative Music Album, and two for the first single, \"Losing My Religion.\" Hats is the second studio album by Scottish band The Blue Nile, originally released on 16 October 1989 on Linn Records and A&M Records. Nuisance is the debut studio album by British rock band Menswear, released on 24 October 1995 by Laurel. The album was preceded by \"I'll Manage Somehow\", \"Daydreamer\" and \"Stardust\"; the former charted in the top 40 while the latter two charted in the top 20. The album peaked at number 11 on the UK album chart. \n",

            "passage:  Abuja (/əˈbuːdʒə/) is the capital city of Nigeria located in the centre of the country within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). It is a planned city and was built mainly in the 1980s, replacing the country's most populous city of Lagos as the capital on 12 December 1991. Abuja's geography is defined by Aso Rock, a 400-metre (1,300 ft) monolith left by water erosion. The Presidential Complex, National Assembly, Supreme Court and much of the city extend to the south of the rock. Zuma Rock, a 792-metre (2,598 ft) monolith, lies just north of the city on the expressway to Kaduna. The airport at Ikeja near Lagos was built during World War II. West African Airways Corporation was formed in 1947 and had its main base at Ikeja. De Havilland Doves were initially operated on WAACs Nigerian internal routes and then West African services. Larger Douglas Dakotas were added to the Ikeja-based fleet from 1957. The airline was launched after Air Sénégal International ceased its operations in 2009, and made its first flights on 25 January 2011. Senegal Airlines's CEO was Edgardo Badiali, the former CEO of GoAir and MyAir. It was 64% privately owned. Civil Aviation in Nigeria is a spin-off of the British Colonial rule. But above all else, it is a product of a mere accident of history dating back to 1925 in the unlikeliest of places - the ancient, walled city of Kano. The airport is named in honor of a former governor and politician-philanthropist, the late Chief Sam Mbakwe of Imo State. It is the first state-government-built airport. Navy Commodore Anthony E. Oguguo, who was military governor of Imo State from 1990 to 1992 during the military regime of General Ibrahim Babangida, commissioned and built the airport. He famously said \"I saw money and looked away, it is not everything; we can all do the same and teach it to our children.\" It was later taken over by the federal government. The only airport in Gambia is at Yundum, built in World War II. Post war it was used for passenger flights. Both British South American Airways and the British Overseas Airways Corporation had services, the former moving its service to Dakar, which had a concrete runway (as opposed to pierced steel planking). The airport was rebuilt in 1963 and the building is still in use today. Blaise Diagne International Airport (, ) is an international airport near the town of Diass, Senegal, east of downtown Dakar. It serves as the main airport for Dakar, replacing Léopold Sédar Senghor International Airport, which became too small. It is named after Blaise Diagne, the first black African elected to France's parliament in 1914. Regular flights are operated from it to destinations across many parts of Africa, as well as to Europe, Macaronesia, the Middle East, and the USA. Diamniadio is a part of the collective development program of the government of Senegal under the leadership of President Macky Sall to revitalize Senegal's economy. The development of the new city is taking place around 30 km from Dakar, close to the Blaise Diagne International Airport, which opened in December 2017. The Diamniadio Lake City is one of its suburbs.  The airport is west of San Antonio de Palé on the southern island of Annobón. It was inaugurated October 15, 2013 in the presence of Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, the President of Equatorial Guinea. Air Senegal , is the flag carrier of the Republic of Senegal. Created in 2016, it is state owned through investment arm Caisse des Dépots et Consignation du Sénégal. It is based at Blaise Diagne International Airport in Dakar, Senegal. \n",

Newer aircraft did not need such fuel stops and, with the demise of the Kano economy in the late 20th century, many international airlines stopped serving the airport. When they indefinitely suspended services to Kano in June 2012, KLM was the only European airline serving Kano, which they had done without interruption since 1947. The airport at Ikeja near Lagos was built during World War II. West African Airways Corporation was formed in 1947 and had its main base at Ikeja. De Havilland Doves were initially operated on WAACs Nigerian internal routes and then West African services. Larger Douglas Dakotas were added to the Ikeja-based fleet from 1957. The airline was launched after Air Sénégal International ceased its operations in 2009, and made its first flights on 25 January 2011. Senegal Airlines's CEO was Edgardo Badiali, the former CEO of GoAir and MyAir. It was 64% privately owned. Abuja (/əˈbuːdʒə/) is the capital city of Nigeria located in the centre of the country within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). It is a planned city and was built mainly in the 1980s, replacing the country's most populous city of Lagos as the capital on 12 December 1991. Abuja's geography is defined by Aso Rock, a 400-metre (1,300 ft) monolith left by water erosion. The Presidential Complex, National Assembly, Supreme Court and much of the city extend to the south of the rock. Zuma Rock, a 792-metre (2,598 ft) monolith, lies just north of the city on the expressway to Kaduna. The airport is named in honor of a former governor and politician-philanthropist, the late Chief Sam Mbakwe of Imo State. It is the first state-government-built airport. Navy Commodore Anthony E. Oguguo, who was military governor of Imo State from 1990 to 1992 during the military regime of General Ibrahim Babangida, commissioned and built the airport. He famously said \"I saw money and looked away, it is not everything; we can all do the same and teach it to our children.\" It was later taken over by the federal government.

The Diamniadio Lake City is one of its suburbs.  The terminal can accommodate around 200,000 passengers annually. The appearance of the interior of the terminal was extensively remodeled. On the air side, the runway was extended from the original 1,400 m x 30 m to 2,250 m x 30 m so that it can accommodate narrow-body aircraft such as the Boeing 737 Next Generation and the C-130 Hercules. The apron was enlarged from the original 80 m x 106 m to 95 m x 150 m. The runway and taxiway was also paved. The airport renovation was finished in 2016 and it was inaugurated by President Joko Widodo on 2 March 2016. \n",

The 1911 International 500-Mile Sweepstakes Race was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Tuesday, May 30, 1911. It was the inaugural running of the Indianapolis 500, which is one of the most prestigious automobile races in the world. Ray Harroun, an engineer with the Marmon Motor Car Company, came out of retirement to drive, and won the inaugural event before re-retiring for good in the winner's circle. Walter White and Walt Jr. retrieve Walt's Pontiac Aztek from an auto repair shop. The mechanic believes the car will last a long time, but when Walt puts on the hat he dons for his Heisenberg persona, his pride takes over: Walt sells the Aztek to the mechanic for $50, leases a new Chrysler 300 for himself, and later leases a new Dodge Challenger for Walt Jr. The Great Pittsburgh Pierogi Race N'at, commonly called the Great Pierogi Race, is an American mascot race between innings during a Pittsburgh Pirates baseball game that features seven contestants racing in giant pierogi costumes: Potato Pete (blue hat), Jalapeño Hannah (green hat), Cheese Chester (yellow hat), Sauerkraut Saul (red hat), Oliver Onion (purple hat), Bacon Burt (orange hat), and Pizza Penny (checkerboard red and white hat). Prior to the introduction of integrated electronic scoring in May 1993, margins of victory were scored in laps, car lengths, or feet, using handheld stopwatches or analog timing clocks. This occasionally led to controversy, such as occurred in the inaugural Daytona 500 in 1959. Initially, NASCAR declared the race won by Johnny Beauchamp, but many observers felt that Lee Petty had won. It took 61 hours before video evidence established Petty as the winner. Patriarch Mario Andretti won the Indianapolis 500 in 1969. In victory lane, prolific car owner Andy Granatelli planted a kiss on the young Andretti's cheek. Following the win, despite a Hall of Fame career in Indy cars, Formula One, stock cars, and sports cars, Andretti never managed to win the race again before his retirement in 1994. The misfortune has extended to his sons Michael and Jeff, nephew John, and grandson Marco, totalling 73 starts. The reasons for defeat have included a bevvy of mechanical failures, crashes, and a last-lap pass in 2006.

            "passage:  The background to the dispute centres on the referee's perceptions that the SFA were not doing enough to protect them from undue criticism and questions over their integrity from football clubs, leading to increasing fears for their personal safety as controversial decisions were debated by the media and fans. After referee Dougie McDonald was found to have lied to his supervisor and Celtic manager Neil Lennon after a game on 17 October 2010, the ensuing controversy and debate led to referees voting to strike on 21 November in an attempt to achieve substantial changes in the game. Immediately after the strike, McDonald opted for early retirement, to allow the ongoing dispute to focus on the issues at hand. The Sir Bobby Robson Trophy match was a charity football match played in honour of the former England and Newcastle United manager, Sir Bobby Robson, and in aid of his cancer charity, the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. Produced under licence by Toast Entertainment Group as The Legends it was played at St James' Park in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, on Sunday 26 July 2009. An immensely moving match that later earned the moniker 'tear-jerker of the decade', the game proved to be Sir Bobby's last public appearance, as he died five days later on the morning of 31 July 2009 aged 76, having been suffering from terminal cancer, his fifth diagnosis in his lifetime. Early estimates were that the charity match raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for the Foundation which he set up in the last years of his life to fund cancer research in his native North East England. Ferguson retired from playing in 2006, and was promoted to the first team coaching staff at Everton in 2014. Following the sacking of Everton manager Marco Silva in December 2019, Ferguson was named as the team's caretaker manager until Silva's replacement Carlo Ancelotti was appointed manager a few weeks later, at which point Ferguson was made assistant manager. Sir Alexander Chapman Ferguson CBE (born 31 December 1941) is a Scottish former football manager and player who managed Manchester United from 1986 to 2013. He is regarded by many players, managers, and analysts to be one of the greatest and most successful managers of all time. After finishing sixth the previous season, Everton started the new season with much hope and ambitions of qualifying for Europe or winning a major trophy. But the mid-season sale of top scoring winger Andrei Kanchelskis to Fiorentina sabotaged Everton's chances of more success, and manager Joe Royle resigned in March, less than two years after guiding the club to FA Cup glory. Captain Dave Watson took over as acting manager and confirmed Everton's survival with a 15th-place finish, before Howard Kendall returned to Goodison Park for his third spell as manager. After defeat in the 1997 Second Division play-off Final, David Webb, Brentford manager since the beginning of the 1993–94 season, moved \"upstairs\" to become the club's new chief executive, having acquired a majority shareholding of the club as part of a consortium with Tony Swaisland (chairman) and John Herting (director) in August 1997. Within days of the takeover and still without a manager, the spine of the previous season's team (Carl Asaba, Barry Ashby and Paul Smith) were sold for six-figure fees, with Brian Statham sold later in the month and promising youngster Marcus Bent transfer-listed. Replacements were found in the lower divisions, non-league and in Premier League reserve teams, with Paul Barrowcliff, Derek Bryan, Leon Townley, Ricky Reina and Charlie Oatway arriving for five-figure fees. First team coach Kevin Lock took caretaker charge of the club until the appointment of Eddie May just four days before the season began, with Clive Walker installed as May's assistant. The sale of key players Jürgen Klinsmann, Gheorghe Popescu and Nick Barmby weakened Tottenham's resources for 1995-96, and manager Gerry Francis was faced with taunts of \"what a waste of money\" from shocked supporters when he paid a club record £4.5million for Crystal Palace striker Chris Armstrong. Robert Paisley OBE (23 January 1919 – 14 February 1996) was an English footballer and manager who spent almost fifty years with Liverpool as a wing half, physiotherapist, coach and manager. Due to his achievements as Liverpool manager, Paisley is regarded as one of the most successful English football managers of all time. Paisley, Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane are the only managers to have won the European Cup three times. During his nine-year tenure as Liverpool manager, Paisley won honours at a rate of 2.2 per season, a rate surpassed only by Pep Guardiola. He is one of five managers to have won the English top-flight championship as both player and manager at the same club, the others being Bill Nicholson (Tottenham Hotspur), Howard Kendall (Everton), George Graham (Arsenal) and Kenny Dalglish (Liverpool), the latter as player/manager. Alan David Hansen (born 13 June 1955) is a Scottish former football player and BBC television football pundit. He played as a central defender for Partick Thistle, for the successful Liverpool team of the late '70s and '80s, and for Scotland. As a football pundit, Hansen is known for his outspoken views, particularly on teams' defensive performances, frequently criticising what he believed was \"diabolical\" or \"shocking\" defending. He made his name as a pundit on \"Match of the Day\" from 1992 to 2014. While his career has been successful, including Premier League titles in 2005 and 2006, Gallas has also had controversy due to on-field behaviour and friction with other personnel. In 2007, he was named Arsenal's captain, but was removed from the role during the 2008–09 season after criticising teammates in a media interview. He left Arsenal at the end of the 2009–10 season, when his contract expired, later signing for rivals Tottenham. He was released at the end of the 2012–13 season when his contract expired. He retired from professional football on 16 October 2014. \n",

            "passage:  Annette Joanne Funicello (October 22, 1942 – April 8, 2013) was an American actress and singer. Funicello began her professional career as a child performer at the age of twelve. She rose to prominence as one of the most popular Mouseketeers on the original \"Mickey Mouse Club\". As a teenager, she transitioned to a successful career as a singer with the pop singles \"O Dio Mio\", \"Tall Paul\" and \"Pineapple Princess\", as well as establishing herself as a film actress, popularizing the successful \"Beach Party\" genre alongside co-star Frankie Avalon during the mid-1960s. Madeline Tourtelot (21 November 1915 – 26 May 2002 ) was an American filmmaker based out of the Chicago metropolitan area. Known for her avant-garde filmmaking style and interest in musical subjects, Tourtelot was a prominent female figure in the Chicago filmmaking community in the 1950s and 60s. She collaborated on films with notable artists such as John Steinbeck, Emilio Fernández, Harry Partch and Edward Bland. Tourtelot founded three artist institutions in the Midwestern United States, and is included in the permanent collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. Tourtelot also studied journalism and worked as a film critic, and a painter, jeweler, photographer, sculptor and printmaker.  The video for the single featured actress/model Patricia Kotero, better known as Apollonia. She would later go on to co-star in the film \"Purple Rain\". Mermaids is a 1990 American comedy-drama film directed by Richard Benjamin and starring Cher, Bob Hoskins, Winona Ryder (who was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for best supporting actress for her role), and Christina Ricci in her first film role. It is based on the 1986 novel of the same title written by Patty Dann. It was shot in and around the towns of Rockport, Gloucester, Ipswich, Lincoln and Pawtucket. American singer and occasional actress Lana Del Rey has appeared in seven films as an actress (two feature length, five short), seven fashion films, and three commercials, as well as offering original music to ten films. Del Rey's first appearance was in the short film \"Poolside\" (2010) as Lisa, a rich girl who spends her days smoking cigarettes by the pool. She received top billing for the project. Del Rey then went on to write the treatment for two music films, \"Ride\" (2012) and \"Tropico\" (2013), which were directed by Anthony Mandler. In 2015, Del Rey served as the executive producer of the film \"Hi, How Are You Daniel Johnston?\". She then made appearances as a performer in \"\" and in \"The King\" as herself. Sonja Kristina (born Sonja Christina Shaw, 14 April 1949, in Brentwood, Essex) is an English songwriter, musician and actress, best known for starring in the seminal 1960s musical \"Hair\", and for being the lead vocalist of the 1970s progressive rock band Curved Air. Christa Päffgen (16 October 1938 – 18 July 1988), known by her stage name Nico, was a German singer, songwriter, musician, model, and actress. She had roles in several films, including Federico Fellini's \"La Dolce Vita\" (1960) and Andy Warhol's \"Chelsea Girls\" (1966). Music From the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack - Mermaids is the soundtrack album from the film \"Mermaids\" starring Cher, Winona Ryder, Christina Ricci, and Bob Hoskins. The film stars Sheila McCarthy as Polly, a worker for a temporary secretarial agency. Polly serves as the narrator for the film, and there are frequent sequences portraying her whimsical fantasies. Polly lives alone, seems to have no friends and enjoys solitary bicycle rides to undertake her hobby of photography. Despite her clumsiness, lack of education, social awkwardness and inclination to take others' statements literally, all of which have resulted in scarce employment opportunities, Polly is placed as a secretary in a private art gallery owned by Gabrielle (Paule Baillargeon). It stars Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Barbara Shelley and Richard Pasco. Written by John Gilling and directed by Terence Fisher, the film was photographed by Michael Reed, and designed by Bernard Robinson. For the score James Bernard combined a soprano with a little-known electronic instrument called the Novachord. The film marks one of the few occasions when Hammer turned to Greek mythology for inspiration; this time it is the legend of the Gorgon that is respun for the Hammer audiences. \n",

            "passage:  The meaning of the song has been debated. The title borrows from the 12th-century Irish Lebor na hUidre (\"Book of the Dun Cow\") manuscript. The lyrics in the opening verse resembles a conventional love song, while the later verses are vague in intention and contain more challenging imagery. A music video was later compiled from footage of the band performing on \"American Bandstand\", coupled with film of Morrison and Pamela Courson at Kern River, near Bakersfield. Milly Scott (born Marion Henriette Louise Molly, 29 December 1933, Den Helder) is a Dutch singer and actress of Surinamese origin, best known for her participation in the 1966 Eurovision Song Contest. Scott is recognised as the first black singer to take part in Eurovision. The first four songs were recorded in May 1973 at Chipping Norton Recording Studios in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. \"P.'s March\", though seemingly a pun on \"peace march\", was meant to be \"Pierre's March\" in honour of the drummer, Pierre van der Linden. The second, or \"B\" motif first appeared as a \"B\" motif in the song, \"Carmen Elysium\", on Thijs van Leer's \"Introspection 2\" album. Written in the classical style by Thijs van Leer, but performed with rock arrangements, this song alternates between uptempo, major key choruses, with melody stated on flute and piccolo, and minor key Bachian verses, with melody stated on electric guitar. \"Can't Believe My Eyes\", originally entitled \"Can't Believe My Ears\" and subtitled \"Dance Macabre\", is a bleak, hard rock instrumental written by Jan Akkerman. In stark contrast is van Leer's gentle jazz ballad \"Focus V.\" \"Out of Vesuvius\" is an excerpt from a 1973 jam session, which would eventually evolve into a long composition like \"Eruption\". \"Glider\" marked a move into disco-funk territory, and was recorded in Brussels, Belgium with drum machine and electric sitar amongst the instrumentation. The song was later rearranged and recorded as \"Mother Focus\". \"Red Sky at Night\" features synthesised bass parts, and was recorded with vocals as \"O Avondrood\" on a Dutch music compilation. Recorded in 1970, \"Spoke the Lord Creator\" was the band's first attempt at using \"Brahms Variations on a Theme by Haydn\" in a rock music context. It was later recorded as \"Starter\" on the 1974 \"Hamburger Concerto\" album. \"Crackers\" is another disco-funk instrumental with extended chords more common to jazz. Lastly, \"Ship of Memories\" is an excerpt of an instrumental on drums and harmonium written and performed by Pierre van der Linden. Maggie Mae Hathaway (July 1, 1911 – September 24, 2001) was an American activist, blues singer, actor, sports writer and golfer. A native of Campti, Louisiana, Hathaway traveled to Los Angeles in 1931 in hopes of playing piano in one of the clubs on Central Avenue, also known as \"Black Broadway\". Instead, she began her career in the area working as an extra in Hollywood films, usually as an \"Egyptian\" or an \"exotic.\" After auditioning for \"Cabin in the Sky\", Hathaway was hired as a body double for Lena Horne throughout much of the film; she later worked as Horne's stand-in in \"Stormy Weather\". However, her Hollywood career ended when she refused to play an extra in a biopic about Woodrow Wilson which required her to wear a bandanna and sit on a bale of cotton. She then returned to singing in cabaret in Los Angeles clubs, recording several songs including “Bayou Baby Blues,” “School Girl Blues,” “A Falling Star” and “When Gabriel Blows His Horn” with The Robins and “Here Goes a Fool” as a solo artist.  Grossman is best known as the young woman languorously stretched out on the cover of Dylan's 1965 album \"Bringing It All Back Home\". She also appeared briefly in the D.A. Pennebaker documentary, \"Dont Look Back\". The album photograph came about after Dylan spent the summer writing and recording at the Grossmans' home. Grossman took part because \"I was around, and Bob just asked me to do it.\" In 1967, H. P. Lovecraft spent much of their pre-recording time rehearsing intensively for several hours at a time. After a few months processing through personnel changes and rehearsal sessions, the band had both a relatively solidified line-up and personalized sound. With assistance from the band members, George Edwards, a creative force within the band, developed the haunting ambiance, and vocal harmonies featuring himself and Dave Michaels, almost total juxtapositions of one another, that made the band synonymous with the psychedelic music scene. Michaels, a classically-trained musician, was a standout for his four-octave span which blended in harmonies reminiscent of Jefferson Airplane. The band finally commenced a tour within the Chicago area and, following the replacement of rhythm guitarist Tom Skidmore with Jerry McGeorge, furthered their development of what would become future tracks recorded in studio sessions. Frankie Ford (August 4, 1939 – September 28, 2015) was an American rock and roll and rhythm and blues singer, best known for his 1959 hit \"Sea Cruise\". The music video for \"If I Could Turn Back Time\", directed by Marty Callner, takes place on board the battleship USS Missouri. It depicts Cher and her band performing a concert for the ship's crew. The video was filmed in Los Angeles on July 1, 1989, while the ship was stationed at the former Long Beach Naval Shipyard at Pier D. In the video, the band plays on the foredeck, and the ship is rigged with spotlights, light racks and strobes. Cher's son, Elijah Blue Allman, only twelve at the time, appears as one of the band's guitarists (he wears dark glasses and a Jimi Hendrix T-shirt). The song was first released by Frankie Ford in 1959 with Smith's original backing track. On the \"Billboard\" charts, it reached number 14 in the Hot 100 and number 11 on the Hot R&B Sides. Released on Ace Records, it sold over one million copies, gaining gold disc status. The single included ship's bell and horn sound-effects, as well as boogie piano, a driving horn section and a beat that anticipated ska music.  Shipyard Sally is a 1939 British musical comedy film directed by Monty Banks and starring Gracie Fields, Sydney Howard and Norma Varden. The film is notable for the song \"Wish Me Luck as You Wave Me Goodbye\", which became a major hit. \n",

            "passage:  Joey Logano came from fourth on the final restart to win his second NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race of the season in the Toyota Owners 400 at Richmond International Raceway. Logano triumphed in a furious battle over the last five laps with Matt Kenseth, Jeff Gordon and Brad Keselowski to score his fifth career win. JTG Daugherty Racing (formerly ST Motorsports and JTG Racing) is an American professional stock car racing team that currently competes in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. The team is owned by former advertising executive Tad Geschickter and his wife Jodi, along with current ESPN analyst Brad Daugherty. The team formerly had alliances with Wood Brothers Racing, then Michael Waltrip Racing, and currently has a technical alliance with Richard Childress Racing. The team currently fields the No. 37 Cottonelle Chevrolet SS driven by Roush development driver Chris Buescher and the No. 47 Clorox/Bush's/Scott Products Chevrolet SS driven by A. J. Allmendinger in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. Prior to the introduction of integrated electronic scoring in May 1993, margins of victory were scored in laps, car lengths, or feet, using handheld stopwatches or analog timing clocks. This occasionally led to controversy, such as occurred in the inaugural Daytona 500 in 1959. Initially, NASCAR declared the race won by Johnny Beauchamp, but many observers felt that Lee Petty had won. It took 61 hours before video evidence established Petty as the winner. Overall, fourteen different drivers have won the Championship, with Ron Hornaday Jr. holding the record for most titles at four. Crafton has the record for most consecutive Drivers' Championships, winning two from 2013 to 2014. Although close on fuel and with a piece of bear bond from Ryan Newman's car stuck to his grill, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. took off on the last restart of the Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway, moving in front of Jeff Gordon. Over the course of the last lap, an intense battle for the runner-up spots unfolded between Jimmie Johnson, Gordon, Brad Keselowski, and Denny Hamlin. Heading through turn 4, Kevin Harvick tried to force himself between Jamie McMurray and Kyle Busch in turn 4, and a wreck ensued as Harvick was sent into the wall, collecting a number of other cars including McMurray, Busch, Carl Edwards, and Reed Sorenson. While that was happening, Earnhardt, Jr. held off Hamlin and took the checkered flag to score his second Daytona 500 victory. Earnhardt, Jr. stated that his car was \"awesome\" and after some help from Gordon on the restart, Earnhardt, Jr. \"just took care of it from there\". Joey Logano won the pole for the race and led a race high of 207 laps before being taken out by Matt Kenseth late in the race and finished 37th. The race had 21 lead changes among nine different drivers, 18 caution flag periods for 109 laps and one red flag period for 12 minutes and 46 seconds. The 2014 season featured eleven different winners, tying a record previously set in 2000 and 2001. Heading into the final race of the season, Will Power led Hélio Castroneves by 51 points. In a race in which Ryan Hunter-Reay's spin produced the only yellow flag, Power finished ninth, while Castroneves – who was penalized for a pit entry violation – finished fourteenth. As a result, Power clinched his first series title by 62 points, and the first drivers' title for Team Penske since Sam Hornish, Jr. in 2006. In the manufacturers' championship, Chevrolet successfully defended their title ahead of Honda. The team last fielded the No. 15 Toyota Camry for Clint Bowyer and the No. 55 Camry for David Ragan. Brian Vickers would normally drive the No. 55, but repeated health problems including blood clotting forced him out for much of 2015. Development driver Brett Moffitt and team owner Waltrip also competed in the car. Between the 2013 and 2014 seasons, several driver changes have occurred. Kevin Harvick will run with JR Motorsports for 13 races. Numerous drivers will move up to the Nationwide Series full-time; Brendan Gaughan, Ty Dillon, Ryan Reed, Dakoda Armstrong, Landon Cassill, as well as 2012 ARCA champion Chris Buescher, and his cousin James Buescher, the 2012 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series champion. Maryeve Dufault will contest a limited schedule. Sam Hornish, Jr. moves from Penske Racing to Joe Gibbs Racing, where he will share a ride with Kyle Busch. Two weeks prior at Kansas Speedway, Jeff Gordon held off a last lap charge by Kevin Harvick to win the 5-hour Energy 400. The first night Cup race at Kansas Speedway was delayed about 30 minutes by rain, saw a bank of backstretch lights go out and featured two multi-car crashes. It ended with Gordon, the points leader, scoring his 89th career Sprint Cup victory. \"I don't know what it is about this team, this '24' car and us here at Kansas on inaugural days, but I love this place,\" Gordon said. \"What an incredible job ... by this race team. They have been giving me the best racecars all year long. I'm going to be 43 year this, but I feel like I'm 25.\" Kevin Harvick had one of the strongest cars and was leading before he made his final pit stop but exited behind Gordon and couldn’t get around him the rest of the race, finishing second. \"What put us in second is I just didn't get down pit road very good. I was paying attention to the fuel pressure gauge instead of the pit lights.\" \n",

            "passage:  Patriation was the political process that led to full Canadian sovereignty, culminating with the Constitution Act, 1982. The process was necessary because under the Statute of Westminster 1931, with Canada's agreement at the time, the British parliament had retained the power to amend Canada's Constitution Acts (Statute of Westminster sec. 7(1)), and to enact more generally for Canada at the request and with the consent of the Dominion (sec. 4). That authority was removed from the UK by the passing of the Canada Act 1982 on March 29, 1982, by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, as requested by the Parliament of Canada. The work is the first presented of what has come to be known as the Mercer Plays (\"Of the Fields\", \"Lately\", \"Salt-Water Moon\", \"1949\", \"Soldier's Heart\"). It has been credited with introducing a unique Canadian voice to the world, and with proving that \"Canadian playwrights could write plays on Canadian subjects and people would flock to see them.\" In the first novel, \"Fireball\", Simon and Brad are cousins who are mysteriously transported to an alternate history Earth, where the Roman Empire did not break up and Europe remains in pre-Dark Ages technology. In an attempt to improve their status in the new realm, Simon and Brad aid the Christian Church, which is oppressed, to launch a coup by introducing the stirrup and the longbow. The coup succeeds, but the boys did not anticipate the Church as a state power would force everyone in the Empire to convert or die. At the end of the first book, they sail away to the New World, which in the realm, was not discovered yet by the Old World. A former colony and then dominion of the United Kingdom, Newfoundland gave up its independence in 1933, following significant economic distress caused by the Great Depression and the aftermath of Newfoundland's participation in World War I. It became the tenth province to enter the Canadian Confederation on March 31, 1949, as \"Newfoundland.\" On December 6, 2001, an amendment was made to the Constitution of Canada to change the province's official name to Newfoundland and Labrador. The municipality was first incorporated on December 24, 1921, as Shackleton and Machin, the names of the two geographic townships that then comprised its territory. It adopted its current name in 1984, renaming itself for its two largest communities. , it includes the two original geographic townships; to the south the eastern half of geographic Macvicar Township, the western half of geographic Carmichael Township, and all of geographic Stringer Township; to the east, the western portion of geographic Haggart Township; and to the north, all of geographic Beardmore Township. Ironically, geographic Fauquier Township is adjacent to the west and is part of the municipality of Moonbeam. Originally named and still colloquially referred to as the \"Maple Leaf card\", the PR card was first proposed in 2001 as part of the Canadian government's overhaul of immigration and security laws following the September 11 attacks in the United States. After the 2001 passage of the new Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the first PR cards were distributed on 28 June 2002. Carrot Rewards was a mobile app for residents of three Canadian provinces and one territory, allowing users to complete health questionnaires and track steps in exchange for rewards points. The app was developed by Toronto-based Carrot Insights, a certified B corporation founded in 2015. The app was first launched in British Columbia during March 2016, followed by Newfoundland and Labrador during June 2016, Ontario during February 2017, and the Northwest Territories only weeks before the app discontinued service in June 2019. Users could choose during sign-up whether they want Aeroplan, Scene, Petro-Points, More Rewards or Drop rewards points. RBC Rewards was also added as an option in June 2018. Survey points were paid for by the organization which created the survey and step points were paid for by the provincial government where the user lives. Carrot Rewards had also partnered with Heart & Stroke, Diabetes Canada and YMCA Canada. The app was later expanded to include questionnaires and surveys on energy conservation and financial literacy. In November 2018, an optional paid tier was added to the Carrot app, allowing users to receive bonus points for completing their goals. Carrot shut down on June 19, 2019, after their \"funds eventually ran out and [they] could no longer be in business\". At the beginning of \"Return Engagement\", North America is a continent divided. Canada, minus the independent Republic of Quebec, is under U.S. occupation — which, as the Confederacy re-arms and the United States redeploy forces south to meet them, has come to mean occupation by U.S.-allied Québécois soldiers. To the south, Kentucky and Houston have recently been returned to the Confederacy by popular vote with Houston also rejoining Texas. However, Sequoyah — having been flooded by U.S. citizens, and its original Native American inhabitants outnumbered, has voted to stay in the United States, but other formerly Confederate territories occupied by the United States after the Great War remain \"unredeemed\". In total, Virginia north of Fredericksburg and the Rappahannock River has been annexed to West Virginia, a sliver of northeastern Arkansas is attached to Missouri, and a portion of northwestern Sonora (purchased by the Confederacy along with Chihuahua in 1881) is part of a larger New Mexico that also contains the real-life state of Arizona. The United States also control the formerly British island territories of the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), Newfoundland, Bermuda and the Bahamas; Cuba, purchased by the Confederacy from Spain in the 1870s, remains Confederate. In this theatrical lament on age and thwarted aspirations, a faery child encounters the newlyweds Shawn and Mary Bruin at their home, shared with Maurteen Bruin and Bridget Bruin, Shawn's parents. The child, who at first is thought of by the Bruins as of gentle birth, denounces God and shocks Father Hart. She expounds on the ephemeral nature of life, in a bid to entice the newly-wed Maire to leave with her to the world of faery: The hair of the girl on the cover was different depending on the region of the release.

            "passage:  Further reforms consisted of a title sponsorship with the Government of Canada, and the inclusion of a financial reward for the overall champion. Subsequently, the tournament managed to attract several notable amateur, and professional clubs with credentials from the USL First Division, Canadian National Challenge Cup, Ligue de Soccer Elite Quebec, and the Ontario Cup. In 2007, the competition reached its zenith as it expanded westward to include clubs from British Columbia with the inclusion of the champion of the British Columbia Provincial Soccer Championship. In 2008, the prize money was increased, but after the creation of the Canadian Championship the competition was disbanded. Since the establishment of the Canadian Championship CSL teams have not participated in the tournament which determines the Canadian entry into the CONCACAF Champions League. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's visit to the city of San Pedro Sula to sign the ceremonial initial agreement in 2011 was the first time a foreign leader had visited Honduras since the 2009 coup d'état. Harper was criticized for engaging in negotiations with the government of Honduran President Pepe Lobo, with observers in Canada saying the country under Lobo is \"an impoverished quasi-dictatorship\" and criticizing Canada's lack of response to human rights concerns in the country. Canada is one of the few developed nations that is a net exporter of energy—in 2009 net exports of energy products amounted to 2.9% of GDP. Most important are the large oil and gas resources centred in Alberta and the Northern Territories, but also present in neighbouring British Columbia and Saskatchewan. The vast Athabasca oil sands give Canada the world's third largest reserves of oil after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela according to USGS. In British Columbia and Quebec, as well as Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and the Labrador region, hydroelectric power is an inexpensive and relatively environmentally friendly source of abundant energy. In part because of this, Canada is also one of the world's highest per capita consumers of energy. Cheap energy has enabled the creation of several important industries, such as the large aluminium industries in British Columbia  and Quebec. In 2012, Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper and Chilean president Sebastian Piñera announced the expansion to the CCFTA, with a financial services chapter in which Canadian financial institutions will enjoy preferential access to the Chilean market and can compete on a level playing field vis-à-vis their competitors. This financial services chapter came into effect in October 2013. By 1965, the United States and Canada have been at war with the Soviet Union and the Chinese People's Republic for three years. Both sides' atomic weapons are ineffective as anti-aircraft missiles shoot down any bombers or guided missiles, so ground forces have done most of the fighting. The Communist nations—whose armies greatly outnumber the North Americans—conquered Western Europe, invaded South America, and are moving toward Texas. All American males are required to either perform agricultural work to feed the armed forces or be drafted into military, construction, or factory service. Food, electricity, and gasoline are rationed, only two CONELRAD stations broadcast on radio, and New York City is reportedly under martial law. Canada–Venezuela relations have been on good terms since the establishment of diplomatic relationship between the two countries in the 1950s. Those relations however began to sour under Conservative Prime Minister Harper and President Hugo Chávez, and became sour under Liberal Prime Minister Trudeau (2015- ) and especially his Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland (2017 - ). Indeed, over the past few years, Canada has stepped out of its comfort zone in hemispheric affairs, to speak and act forcefully, as Minister Freeland put it, in solidarity with \"the people of Venezuela and their desire to restore democracy and human in Venezuela\". On January 23rd, 2019, Minister Freeland issued the statement that “Canada recognizes Juan Guaidó, President of the National Assembly, as the interim President of Venezuela.\" On that occasion she called the Nicolás Maduro government \"despicable\". Ottawa imposed targeted sanctions (under the \"Special Economic Measures Act\" and the new \"Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act\") against 70 Maduro government officials. Canada has sanctions and related measures in place against nineteen other countries in the world, but only against Venezuela in the southern hemisphere. China was Canada's largest trading partner in Asia for some years, including 2017; it was Canada's top export market and it was Canada's top import supplier in Asia. On the other hand, Canada had a significant trade imbalance, importing CA$44.235 billion more from China than the value of its exports to that country in 2016, for example. Aquilegia canadensis, the Canadian or Canada columbine, eastern red columbine, or wild columbine, is a species of flowering plant in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae. It is an herbaceous perennial native to woodland and rocky slopes in eastern North America, prized for its red and yellow flowers. It readily hybridizes with other species in the genus \"Aquilegia\". Alberta Premier Ralph Klein announced that each person in Alberta would receive $400 sometime in January 2006. This represented $1.4 billion (20%) of the $6.8 billion surplus. The money was not taxed by either the federal or provincial governments. In the spring of 2017, gardeners in southern Ontario reported that some of the tulips blossomed with the incorrect colour of orange, as opposed to the red and white colour as advertised, or did not bloom at all. Home Hardware is investigating, and offering refunds to customers who purchased the incorrect bulbs. \n",

Double Duty also referred to as the Indy-Charlotte Double or Memorial Day Double, refers to an accomplishment in automobile racing in which a driver competes in the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 in the same day. The feat was first attempted by John Andretti on May 29, 1994. In 2001, Tony Stewart became the first and only driver to date to successfully complete all 1,100 miles of both races in the same day. The two races, organized by separate sanctioning bodies—IndyCar and NASCAR respectively—are held on Memorial Day weekend, and are considered two of the biggest annual events on the U.S. motorsports calendar. The 2013 Toyota Owners 400 was a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series stock car race that was held on April 27, 2013, at Richmond International Raceway in Richmond, Virginia, United States.

However, on May 4, 2017, due to a rear suspension issue, Logano's win was encumbered. It did not count as a ticket to the Playoffs, which ultimately cost Logano a berth in the post-season, since he did not win again during the regular season nor point his way in. The 2016 Toyota Owners 400 was a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race held on April 24, 2016, at Richmond International Raceway in Richmond, Virginia.

The series focuses on the work and home life of a suburban police commissioner in upstate New York. Hawkins is a television series which aired for one season on CBS between 1973 and 1974. The mystery, created by Robert Hamner and David Karp, starred James Stewart as rural-bred lawyer Billy Jim Hawkins, who investigated the cases he was involved in, similarly to Stewart's earlier smash hit movie \"Anatomy of a Murder\" (1959). Despite being critically well received and winning a Golden Globe Award (Best Actor in Television Drama Series, Stewart), the series was cancelled after one season consisting of eight 90-minute episodes. Stewart requested the cancellation since he believed that the quality of scripts and directors in television could not continuously measure up to the level to which he was accustomed with theatrical films. Barney Blake, Police Reporter is an American crime drama that aired live on NBC from April 22, 1948 to July 8, 1948. NBC claimed it was the first mystery series to air on TV. The program was canceled after thirteen weeks by its sponsor American Tobacco Company. Lock-Up is an American crime drama series that premiered in syndication in September 1959 and concluded in June 1961. The half-hour episodes had little time for character development or subplots and presented a compact story without embellishment. The show was created by Steven Bochco and David Milch, and was inspired by Milch's relationship with Bill Clark, a former member of the New York City Police Department who eventually became one of the show's producers. The series was originally broadcast on the ABC network, debuted on September 21, 1993‚ and aired its final episode on March 1, 2005. It was ABC's longest-running primetime one-hour drama series until Grey's Anatomy surpassed it in 2016. Hazel is an American sitcom about a live-in maid named Hazel Burke (played by Shirley Booth) and her employers, the Baxters. The five-season, 154-episode series aired in prime time from September 28, 1961, to April 11, 1966, and was produced by Screen Gems. The first four seasons of \"Hazel\" aired on NBC, and the fifth and final season aired on CBS. Season 1 was broadcast in black-and-white except for one episode which was in color, and seasons 2–5 were all broadcast in color. The show was based on the single-panel comic strip of the same name by cartoonist Ted Key, which appeared in \"The Saturday Evening Post\". This is a list of episodes from \"Quincy, M.E.\", an American crime-investigation and mystery series. It was originally broadcast on NBC from October 3, 1976, to September 4, 1983.

M Squad is an American crime drama television series that ran from 1957 to 1960 on NBC. It was produced by Lee Marvin's Latimer Productions and Revue Studios.

Alternate sponsors were General Electric (GE), Hazel Bishop and Bulova watches. Quincy, M.E. (also called Quincy) is an American mystery medical drama television series from Universal Studios that aired on NBC from October 3, 1976, to May 11, 1983. Jack Klugman stars in the title role as a Los Angeles County medical examiner who routinely engages in police investigations. Compact was a British television soap opera shown by the BBC from 1962 to 1965. The series was created by Hazel Adair and Peter Ling, who together subsequently devised \"Crossroads\". In contrast to the kitchen sink realism of \"Coronation Street\", \"Compact\" was a distinctly middle-class serial, set in the more \"sophisticated\" arena of magazine publishing. An early \"avarice\" soap, it took the viewer into the business workplace, and aligned the professional lives of the characters with more personal storylines. The show was scheduled for broadcast on Tuesdays and Thursdays, thus avoiding a clash with ITV's \"Coronation Street\" on Mondays and Wednesdays. \n",

            "passage:  In Metropolitan France, the school year runs from early September to early July. The school calendar is standardised throughout the country and is the sole domain of the ministry. The 2017 Arizona Diamondbacks season was the franchise's 20th season in Major League Baseball and their 20th season at Chase Field and in Phoenix, Arizona. They began the season on April 2 at home against the San Francisco Giants. The Diamondbacks finished the season 93–69 to finish in second place in the National League West Division, 11 games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers. They also flipped their record from the previous year, in which they went 69-93.  The team is led by owner Edwin F. Hale, Sr. and head coach Danny Kelly. The Blast entered the season as defending champions as they defeated the Sonora Suns in the Ron Newman Cup finals in April 2016. Following an 8-4 victory on February 17 over the Syracuse Silver Knights, Baltimore clinched a playoff berth in the Eastern Division for the 2017 Ron Newman Cup playoffs. The Blast then clinched the regular-season Eastern Division championship after a 5-4 overtime win in Syracuse on February 24. The 2016 series saw three changes to the format. One of the two American meetings, the Adidas Grand Prix held in New York, was dropped from the calendar in favour of the Rabat Meeting in Morocco. This was the first meeting on the calendar to be held in Africa, which had previously been the only northern hemisphere continent not represented on the Diamond League. The second major change was an amendment to the point scoring system. The former model of four points for the winner, two for runner-up and one for third was overhauled with a broader points system giving ten to the winner, six the runner-up and progressively fewer points down to sixth place. The system of double points for the event finals was retained. A third change was the compression of the field events – throws and horizontal jumps allowed three attempts for all athletes, then the top four athletes at that point of the competition were permitted an additional three attempts (as opposed to the previous format of all athletes receiving six attempts). SK Gaming and Fnatic were the only returning Legends, as it was the fewest returning Legends in major history; the two teams ended up being the only remaining teams to make the playoffs out off all the majors both teams attended, with Fnatic's run starting at and SK Gaming's run starting at ESL One Katowice 2015, in which the Brazilians were with the organization Keyd Stars. FaZe Clan, G2 Esports, Natus Vincere, Quantum Bellator Fire, Cloud9, and mousesports were new Legends. Defending champions Gambit Esports, 100 Thieves (formerly Immortals), Astralis, BIG, North, and Virtus.pro were out as Legends after five teams were knocked out in the New Legends stage and 100 Thieves not making the major due to visa issues. This marked the first time Astralis's core three – Nicolai \"dev1ce\" Reedtz, Peter \"dupreeh\" Rothmann, and Andreas \"Xyp9x\" Højsleth – did not make the playoffs for the first time in Global Offensive major history, leaving just Olof \"olofmeister\" Kajbjer of FaZe Clan and Freddy \"KRIMZ\" Johansson of Fnatic as the only two remaining players to become Legends at all twelve majors. Compared to the previous year, the Birmingham meeting moved venues to Gateshead due to stadium renovations, while the Prefontaine Classic returned to Eugene, Oregon following completion of its renovation. Initial plans for the 2020 season were to remove the Stockholm Bauhaus Athletics from the series and condense the calendar into a much shorter time-frame, but these plans were abandoned after a five-year title sponsorship deal with Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group. The first game at the complex was held on March 25, 2017, when Rising FC hosted Toronto FC II in front of a crowd of 6,890 fans. They won their first game at the stadium on April 8 by defeating LA Galaxy II 2–1. Luke Rooney scored both goals, the first one on a penalty kick. They were the first goals scored by the team in their new stadium. The 2017 Desert Diamond Cup was the seventh edition of the preseason exhibition tournament. The competition featured six soccer teams from Major League Soccer, held from February 15 to February 25, 2017. The defending champion was the New England Revolution.

            "passage:  War of the Worlds '15 was a two-day professional wrestling supershow co-produced by the American Ring of Honor (ROH) and Japanese New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) promotions. The events took place on May 12 and 13, 2015, at the 2300 Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S. Both nights were released by ROH on video on demand (VOD) the following week. The Four Nations Tournament (German: \"Vier-Länder-Turnier\") was an invitational association football competition between four national teams, organized by the German Football Association (DFB). The teams of West Germany, Soviet Union, Argentina and Sweden competed against one another at Olympic Stadium, West Berlin from 31 March to 2 April 1988, with Sweden the tournament winners. The tournament was played at numerous venues across India, including Goa (which hosted the semi-finals and the final), Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad and Bangalore. The gathering brought together leaders, representatives and policymakers from non-aligned nations. African G-15 nations are Algeria, Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, and Zimbabwe. Those from Asia are India, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka. Latin American G-15 nations include Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. The 2014 IAAF Diamond League was the fifth edition of the annual Diamond League. It consisted of fourteen one-day track and field meetings, starting on May 9, 2014 in Doha, Qatar and ending on September 5, 2014 in Brussels, Belgium. Other events were held in Shanghai, Eugene, Oslo, Rome, New York City, Lausanne, Paris, Fontvieille, Stockholm, Birmingham and Zürich. Glasgow, Great Britain hosted the event for the first time on July 11 & 12, 2014 at Hampden Park. The acronym BRIC (for Brazil, Russia, India, China) was first used in a Goldman Sachs thesis projecting that the economic potential of Brazil, Russia, India and China is such that they may become among the five most dominant economies by the year 2050. Today, the four countries produce about 15 percent of the world’s gross domestic product and hold about 40 percent of the gold and hard currency reserves. The main result was the Treaty of Versailles with Germany, which in section 231 laid the guilt for the war on \"the aggression of Germany and her allies\". This provision proved humiliating for Germany and set the stage for the expensive reparations Germany was intended to pay (it paid only a small portion before reparations ended in 1931). The five major powers (France, Britain, Italy, Japan and the United States of America) controlled the Conference. And the \"Big Four\" were the Prime Minister of France, Georges Clemenceau; the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Lloyd George; the President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson; and the Prime Minister of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele Orlando. They met together informally 145 times and made all the major decisions, which in turn were ratified by the others. The conference began on January 18, 1919 and with respect to its end date Professor Michael Neiberg has noted: The summits that garnered most general public and media attention were the Quebec City and Mar del Plata events, both of which provoked very large anti-globalization and anti–Free Trade Area of the Americas protests and attendant police response. The event took place from June 28 to June 30, 2010 in Chongqing, People's Republic of China. The Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) was signed during the meeting on the 29th. Chongqing was chosen because the city has about 80,000 families that have a relationship with Taiwan. Chongqing was also on the list of Terry Gou's list of consideration for northern cities after the 2010 Foxconn suicides in southern city Shenzhen. The 2016 series saw three changes to the format. One of the two American meetings, the Adidas Grand Prix held in New York, was dropped from the calendar in favour of the Rabat Meeting in Morocco. This was the first meeting on the calendar to be held in Africa, which had previously been the only northern hemisphere continent not represented on the Diamond League. The second major change was an amendment to the point scoring system. The former model of four points for the winner, two for runner-up and one for third was overhauled with a broader points system giving ten to the winner, six the runner-up and progressively fewer points down to sixth place. The system of double points for the event finals was retained. A third change was the compression of the field events – throws and horizontal jumps allowed three attempts for all athletes, then the top four athletes at that point of the competition were permitted an additional three attempts (as opposed to the previous format of all athletes receiving six attempts). \n",

            "passage:  \"Midnight Club: Los Angeles\" is set in the city of Los Angeles, again providing an option to completely free-roam (in an open world environment larger than all the three cities combined from the previous game, \"\"). New additions are a 24-hour day-to-night cycle, weather effects and traffic with licensed vehicles, adding a realistic aspect to the game. The new dynamic weather system has been reported to alter the gameplay experience, making the vehicle more prone to sliding on slick surfaces. If any damage is inflicted upon a vehicle after races, the player does not necessarily need to drive back to a garage for a full repair, but, instead, can choose the \"Quick Fix\" option through which old, junkyard-esque parts will be added to the car. To get back that \"nice, new car look\", the player must actually drive back to repair their vehicle at a garage or gas station. This also means that totaling a vehicle is only possible within a single race or event. With the RAGE system being used for this game, traffic levels fluctuate throughout the day, with light traffic at night, heavy traffic in the morning and afternoon, and heaviest traffic in the evenings. Motorcycles are again part of the game, including the Ducati 999R and the Kawasaki Ninja ZX-14. Convertible cars, customizable interiors, in-game photo mode, and customizable exotics are all new additions. Developers placed great emphasis on the elimination of load screens, stating that the player could literally jump from career mode to an online race in under ten seconds. The season was ordered on March 2016 and every cast member from the last season returned with the exception of Zabryna Guevara as Sarah Essen; James Frain as Theo Galavan/Azrael; and Nicholas D'Agosto as Harvey Dent. New additions to the cast include Benedict Samuel as Jervis Tetch; and Maggie Geha as a grown Ivy Pepper, recasting the role portrayed by Clare Foley in previous seasons. The season was broadcast over three consecutive runs: the first 11 episodes aired from September to November 2016; the next three aired in January 2017; and the other eight episodes aired from April to June 2017. Like the previous season, the season also holds two subtitles. The first 14 episodes are subtitled \"Mad City\" while the other eight episodes are subtitled \"Heroes Rise\". The season premiered on September 19, 2016 and concluded on June 5, 2017 with a two-hour finale on Fox. The 2017 Desert Diamond Cup was the seventh edition of the preseason exhibition tournament. The competition featured six soccer teams from Major League Soccer, held from February 15 to February 25, 2017. The defending champion was the New England Revolution. The series began on 11 May in Doha, Qatar and ended on 7 September in Brussels, Belgium. The following fourteen meetings are scheduled to be included in the 2018 season: The 2015 race was extended due to a green-white-checker finish, and saw the most cautions issued. In 1907 the Peking to Paris automobile race had inspired an even bolder test of these new machines. The following year the course would be from New York City, USA, to Paris, France with a 150-mile (240 km) ship passage from Nome, Alaska, across the Bering Strait to East Cape, Siberia, this at a time when \"the motor car is the most fragile and capricious thing on earth.\" The 2016 series saw three changes to the format. One of the two American meetings, the Adidas Grand Prix held in New York, was dropped from the calendar in favour of the Rabat Meeting in Morocco. This was the first meeting on the calendar to be held in Africa, which had previously been the only northern hemisphere continent not represented on the Diamond League.

A third change was the compression of the field events – throws and horizontal jumps allowed three attempts for all athletes, then the top four athletes at that point of the competition were permitted an additional three attempts (as opposed to the previous format of all athletes receiving six attempts). \"Project Gotham Racing\" differs from most racing games in that winning a race does not necessarily mean the player advances to the next round; instead advancement in \"Project Gotham Racing\" requires both driving fast enough to meet the challenge set, and scoring enough Kudos points to advance. Kudos points are gained through the player's driving skills, such as power sliding around a corner at speed, or overtaking non-player characters in the race. There are four world cities realistically recreated, including San Francisco, London, Tokyo, and New York City. The venue is expanded from 2017 and the track covers 2.373km with 14 corners, with viewing from grandstands and expecting 80,000 attendees. The NYPD will close off selected streets surrounding the Ferry Slip from Van Brunt St to all vehicle traffic and PANYNJ Police will provide additional coverage for the waterways and venue. All drop-off and ride-share will be from designated area E4 and a free shuttle runs from Barclays Center and the NYCT 'F' line station at Smith St. \n",

            "passage:  Quartier des Spectacles is an entertainment district that is projected to cost 1.9 billion dollars. The construction began in 2008 and the project is planned to be completed in 2025. The series began on 10 May in Doha, Qatar and ended on 6 September in Brussels, Belgium. The 2016 series saw three changes to the format. One of the two American meetings, the Adidas Grand Prix held in New York, was dropped from the calendar in favour of the Rabat Meeting in Morocco.

The Eiffel Tower (/ˈaɪfəl/ EYE-fəl; French: tour Eiffel [tuʁ‿ɛfɛl] ( listen)) is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. The Tour Majunga is a building under interior completion in La Défense, near Paris, in France. It reached a height of (top of its spire) in January 2014 and became the fourth tallest skyscraper in France, after First (231 m), Montparnasse (210 m) and Incity (200 m). The series began on 11 May in Doha, Qatar and ended on 7 September in Brussels, Belgium. The tour du millénaire (French for \"tower of the millennium\") was a vantage point built in 2001 in Gedinne, Belgium just meters away from the French border. The Diamond League's format was completely overhauled for the 2017 edition. The Diamond Race system used in previous years, in which athletes accumulated points through the season with double points in the finals, was replaced with a championship-style format in which earlier meets act as qualifying meets for the finals; the top eight or twelve athletes, depending on the event, will qualify. The two final meetings are held at the end of the season in Zürich (Weltklasse) and Brussels (Memorial Van Damme), with half of the 32 events contested in each final; the overall Diamond League championship in each event will be determined solely by the results of the finals. While not previously used in the Diamond League, this new system is similar to the old IAAF Grand Prix circuit with its IAAF Grand Prix Final. The 3rd edition of the Prix Versailles recognized 12 world winners from amongst the 70 continental winners, in four categories: shops & stores, shopping malls, hotels and restaurants. On 29 January 2019, French urban climber Alain Robert climbed the building and was arrested upon finishing his descent. \n",

            "passage:  This is a list of seasons completed by the Houston Texans American football franchise of the National Football League (NFL). The list documents the season-by-season records of the Texans' franchise from to present, including postseason records, and league awards for individual players or head coaches. The team currently has seven winning seasons, two 8–8 seasons, and eight losing seasons. The Texans clinched their first playoff berth and AFC South title on December 11, 2011 by beating the Cincinnati Bengals 20–19. The Colts–Texans rivalry is a professional American football rivalry in the National Football League (NFL) between the Indianapolis Colts and the Houston Texans. While being one of the newest rivalries in the NFL due to the Texans' formation in 2002 and the Colts' reallocation to the AFC South division that year, this rivalry has increased in intensity over the 2010s despite being lopsided in favor of Indianapolis during the 2000s.  The Texans–Titans rivalry is an intense rivalry, pitting the Tennessee Titans (formerly based in Houston as the Houston Oilers) with Houston's present-day team, the Texans. The 2002 expansion and conference realignment by the NFL put a new team into Houston. With the expansion Texans in place, the NFL's realignment created the AFC South and put the two teams together as division rivals. The Titans lead the series 19–17. The two teams have not met in the postseason. On May 13, 2019, June Jones left his position with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats to become Houston's head coach. The XFL confirmed the hire May 20. The Steelers–Titans rivalry is a National Football League rivalry between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Tennessee Titans that dates back to the 1970s when the Steelers and then-Houston Oilers played in the AFC Central. The two teams were realigned into separate divisions for the 2002 NFL season, however matchups are still considered heated between the two teams. The Texas Derby is a soccer rivalry (derby) between the Houston Dynamo and FC Dallas, recognizing the best club in the state for the season. The two squads play a series of games with the series winner taking home \"El Capitán\", a replica 18th century mountain howitzer cannon. The all-time series is tied, 7–7. The professional American football team now known as the Tennessee Titans previously played in Houston, Texas as the Houston Oilers from 1960 to 1996. The Oilers began play in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL). The team won two AFL championships before joining the NFL as part of the AFL–NFL merger in the late 1960s. The game matched the Eastern Division champion Houston Oilers (10–4), against the Western Division champion Los Angeles Chargers (10–4), in the first championship game of the new American Football League. The host Oilers were favored by 6 to 6½ points. The club first played in as an expansion team, making them the youngest franchise currently competing in the NFL. The Texans replaced the city's previous NFL franchise, the Houston Oilers, which moved to Nashville, Tennessee and are now known as the Tennessee Titans. The team was founded and owned by Bob McNair from 1999 until his death in 2018. Following McNair's death, the majority ownership of the team went to his wife, Janice McNair, and his son, D. Cal McNair. The Broncos were barely competitive during their 10-year run in the AFL and their first seven years in the NFL. They did not complete a winning season until 1973. In 1977, four years later, they qualified for the playoffs for the first time in franchise history and advanced to Super Bowl XII. Since 1975, the Broncos have become one of the NFL's more successful teams, having suffered only seven losing seasons. They have won eight AFC Championships (1977, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1997, 1998, 2013, 2015, and three Super Bowl championships (1997 (XXXII), 1998 (XXXIII), 2015 (50). However, the Broncos have the NFL record for most Super Bowl losses (5). They have five players in the Pro Football Hall of Fame: John Elway, Floyd Little, Gary Zimmerman, Shannon Sharpe, and the most recently elected member, Terrell Davis. \n",

            "passage:  Journalists on the bus following the team reported the incident in the next day's newspapers, and it became national news. Although Linz was fined for the incident, he received an endorsement contract from harmonica manufacturer Hohner after the company saw an increase in sales. The contract more than made up for Linz's lost money from the fine. Radio stations in Boston urged fans of the Red Sox, whom the Yankees played immediately afterward, to greet Linz at the plate in Fenway Park with a harmonica and kazoo serenade. At an exhibition game against the crosstown New York Mets, Mets players tossed harmonicas onto the field. Ten Cent Beer Night was a promotion held by Major League Baseball's Cleveland Indians during a game against the Texas Rangers at Cleveland Stadium on Tuesday, June 4, 1974. The Curse of the Billy Goat was a sports-related curse that was supposedly placed on the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise in 1945, by Billy Goat Tavern owner William Sianis. The curse lasted 71 years, from 1945 to 2016. Because the odor of his pet goat, named Murphy, was bothering other fans, Sianis was asked to leave Wrigley Field, the Cubs' home ballpark, during game 4 of the 1945 World Series. Outraged, Sianis allegedly declared, \"Them Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more,\" which had been interpreted to mean that the Cubs would never win another National League (NL) pennant, at least for the remainder of Sianis's life. The Broncos radically changed their logo and uniforms in 1997, a design that the team continues to use to this day. The new logos and uniforms were unveiled on February 4, 1997. Navy blue replaced royal blue on the team's color scheme. The current logo is a profile of a horse's head, with an orange mane and navy blue outlines. The Broncos' popular live animal mascot Thunder was the inspiration to incorporate a horse-head profile as part of the logo on the team's helmets. During a February 4, 1997 press conference introducing the new logo, the team president and the art director for Nike, who were the creators of the new design, described it as \"a powerful horse with a fiery eye and mane.\" The 1979 Detroit Tigers finished in fifth place in the American League East with a record of 85-76, 18 games behind the Orioles. They outscored their opponents 770 to 738. The Tigers drew 1,630,929 fans to Tiger Stadium in 1979, ranking 7th of the 14 teams in the American League. This season is most notable for both the Tigers' involvement in the infamous Disco Demolition Night, of which they were the visiting team to the Chicago White Sox and declared winners by forfeit, as well as for their mid-season hiring of Sparky Anderson as manager. Anderson would manage the Tigers through the end of the 1995 season, winning the 1984 World Series along with two American League Eastern Division titles in 1984 and 1987. Around the 1971 football season, the Southwest Conference created a rule forbidding the bringing of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school permitted it. Since the Masked Rider's horse might have been prohibited from attending some games under this rule, Raider Red was created as an alternate mascot. Texas Tech now plays in the Big 12 Conference, but the tradition of having both mascots continues. The 1985 infringement claim was based on USPA's use of the word Polo on their retail clothing and fragrances as well as a logo similar to that of Polo Ralph Lauren. Polo Ralph Lauren, which was founded in 1967, began using a solid image of a horseman playing polo as their logo after the release of their men’s fragrance in 1978. A few years later, USPA released a men's fragrance in a similar dark blue package with a solid image of two horsemen playing polo as their logo. The judge ruled that USPA would be allowed to use the logo as so long as they make changes to clearly distinguish it from Polo Ralph Lauren so it does not confuse consumers. The Lauren company was granted the right to use trademarks that USPA argued were generic to the sport of polo. The Harmonica Incident took place on a New York Yankees team bus on August 20, 1964, en route to O'Hare International Airport. Infielder Phil Linz, slightly resentful at not being played during a four-game sweep by the Chicago White Sox that was believed at the time to have seriously set back the Yankees' chances at that year's American League pennant, began playing a harmonica in the back of the bus. Manager Yogi Berra, feeling that Linz's behavior was inappropriate given the team's recent poor performance, angrily called on him to stop, whereupon Linz threw the harmonica and loudly complained about being singled out despite not having been at fault for the losses. Although the controversial logo Chief Wahoo has been officially removed, the Cleveland Indians remain part of the Native American mascot controversy which has led over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts to publish resolutions or policies that state that any use of Native American names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a harmful form of ethnic stereotyping that promote misunderstanding and prejudice which contributes to other problems faced by Native Americans.  The Chicago Winds was the World Football League's ill-fated 1975 successor to the Chicago Fire. The team was so named because Chicago was nicknamed \"The Windy City.\" The Winds played at Soldier Field and the team was assigned to the WFL's Western Division for 1975 (the league having shrunk from 12 franchises to 11, and from three divisions to two). \n",

With New Year's on Sunday, the major college bowl games were played on Monday, January 2. The National Football League playoffs for the 1978 season began on December 24, 1978. The postseason tournament concluded with the Pittsburgh Steelers defeating the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XIII, 35–31, on January 21, 1979, at the Orange Bowl in Miami. In the first quarter, Notre Dame scored the first 12 points of the game, but Houston scored a touchdown off a turnover. Aided by the direction of the wind, Houston gained the lead in the second quarter and led 20–12 at halftime. When the teams returned to the field to start the second half, Joe Montana remained in the locker room. The National Football League playoffs for the 1979 season began on December 23, 1979. The postseason tournament concluded with the Pittsburgh Steelers defeating the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl XIV, 31–19, on January 20, 1980, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. The game matched the Eastern Division champion Houston Oilers against the Western Division champion San Diego Chargers two of only three AFL teams with winning records in the 1961 season. (The other was the Boston Patriots at  The 1961 American Football League Championship Game was a rematch of the first AFL title game, between the Houston Oilers and the San Diego Chargers (formerly the Los Angeles Chargers). It was played on December 24 at Balboa Stadium in San Diego, California, and the Oilers were three-point favorites. The 1979 Cotton Bowl Classic, popularly called the Chicken Soup Game, was a football game played between the University of Notre Dame and the University of Houston. The game took place on an unusually cold day in Dallas, Texas, played the day after the city's worst ice storm in thirty years. Quarterback Joe Montana, who had the flu, led Notre Dame to a come-from-behind victory in the second half after eating a bowl of The Irish outscored the Cougars in the fourth quarter. During the early 1960s, NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle envisioned the possibility of playing at least one game weekly during prime time that could be viewed by a greater television audience (while the NFL had scheduled Saturday night games on the DuMont Television Network in 1953 and 1954, poor ratings and the dissolution of DuMont led to those games being eliminated by the time CBS took over the rights in 1956). An early bid by the league in 1964 to play on Friday nights was soundly defeated, with critics charging that such telecasts would damage the attendance at high school football games. Undaunted, Rozelle decided to experiment with the concept of playing on Monday night, scheduling the Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions for a game on September 28, 1964. While the game was not televised, it drew a sellout crowd of 59,203 spectators to Tiger Stadium, the largest crowd ever to watch a professional football game in Detroit up to that point. The game matched the Eastern Division champion Houston Oilers (10–4), against the Western Division champion Los Angeles Chargers (10–4), in the first championship game of the new American Football League. The host Oilers were favored by 6 to 6½ points. The season ended when the Houston Oilers defeated the Los Angeles Chargers 24–16 in the inaugural AFL Championship game. \n",

            "passage:  The Colts–Texans rivalry is a professional American football rivalry in the National Football League (NFL) between the Indianapolis Colts and the Houston Texans. While being one of the newest rivalries in the NFL due to the Texans' formation in 2002 and the Colts' reallocation to the AFC South division that year, this rivalry has increased in intensity over the 2010s despite being lopsided in favor of Indianapolis during the 2000s.  The Broncos were barely competitive during their 10-year run in the AFL and their first seven years in the NFL. They did not complete a winning season until 1973. In 1977, four years later, they qualified for the playoffs for the first time in franchise history and advanced to Super Bowl XII. Since 1975, the Broncos have become one of the NFL's more successful teams, having suffered only seven losing seasons. They have won eight AFC Championships (1977, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1997, 1998, 2013, 2015, and three Super Bowl championships (1997 (XXXII), 1998 (XXXIII), 2015 (50). However, the Broncos share the NFL record for most Super Bowl losses (5) with the New England Patriots. They have five players in the Pro Football Hall of Fame: John Elway, Floyd Little, Gary Zimmerman, Shannon Sharpe,Terrell Davis and most recently elected member,John Lynch who played with Denver from 2004-2007. This is a list of seasons completed by the Houston Texans American football franchise of the National Football League (NFL). The list documents the season-by-season records of the Texans' franchise from to present, including postseason records, and league awards for individual players or head coaches. The team currently has seven winning seasons, two 8–8 seasons, and eight losing seasons. The Texans clinched their first playoff berth and AFC South title on December 11, 2011 by beating the Cincinnati Bengals 20–19. The Steelers–Titans rivalry is a National Football League rivalry between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Tennessee Titans that dates back to the 1970s when the Steelers and then-Houston Oilers played in the AFC Central. The two teams were realigned into separate divisions for the 2002 NFL season, however matchups are still considered heated between the two teams. On May 13, 2019, June Jones left his position with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats to become Houston's head coach. The XFL confirmed the hire May 20. The bowl was sponsored at its inception by Raycom Media, a major owner of television stations in the southeastern United States with heavy involvement in college sports broadcasting, and was officially known as the Raycom Media Camellia Bowl. In June 2018, Gray Television announced its intent to acquire Raycom; the acquisition was completed in January 2019. The 2019 edition of the bowl was played without a title sponsor. The Texans–Titans rivalry is an intense rivalry, pitting the Tennessee Titans (formerly based in Houston as the Houston Oilers) with Houston's present-day team, the Texans. The 2002 expansion and conference realignment by the NFL put a new team into Houston. With the expansion Texans in place, the NFL's realignment created the AFC South and put the two teams together as division rivals. The Titans lead the series 19–17. The two teams have not met in the postseason. The Houston Cougars college football team competes as part of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), representing the University of Houston in the American Athletic Conference (AAC). Since the establishment of the team in 1946, Houston has appeared in 26 bowl games. The latest bowl occurred on December 22, 2018, when Houston fell to Army in the 2018 Armed Forces Bowl, which brought the Cougars' overall bowl record to eleven wins, fifteen losses, and one tie (11–15–1). The club first played in as an expansion team, making them the youngest franchise currently competing in the NFL. The Texans replaced the city's previous NFL franchise, the Houston Oilers, which moved to Nashville, Tennessee and are now known as the Tennessee Titans. The team was founded and owned by Bob McNair from 1999 until his death in 2018. Following McNair's death, the majority ownership of the team went to his wife, Janice McNair, and his son, D. Cal McNair. The Texas Derby is a soccer rivalry (derby) between the Houston Dynamo and FC Dallas, recognizing the best club in the state for the season. The two squads play a series of games with the series winner taking home \"El Capitán\", a replica 18th century mountain howitzer cannon. The all-time series is tied, 7–7. \n",

Tiger Woods won all four major events consecutively within a 365-day period, but his victories were spread over two calendar years (winning three events in 2000 and the Masters in 2001). The term also refers to a former tour tournament, the PGA Grand Slam of Golf, an annual off-season tournament (that was cancelled after the 2014 tournament) contested by the winners of the four major championships. The Masters is a professional invitational snooker tournament. Held every year since 1975, it is the second-longest running tournament behind the World Championship. It is one of the Triple Crown events, and although not a ranking event, it is regarded as one of the most prestigious tournaments on the circuit. The reigning champion is Judd Trump.

It was 11 years after his last major win, the 2008 U.S. Open, and 14 years since his last Masters win beating the previous record of 13 years held by Gary Player. Due to the high profile of Woods, and his storied fall from the top of the game due to personal issues and injuries, the victory generated a large amount of publicity around the world, and is regarded as one of the great sporting comebacks.

The foco theory of revolution by way of guerrilla warfare, also known as focalism, was formulated by French intellectual and government official Régis Debray, whose main source of inspiration was Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara's experiences surrounding his rebel army's victory in the 1959 Cuban Revolution. The Citadelle Laferrière or, Citadelle Henri Christophe, or simply the Citadelle , is a large mountaintop fortress in Nord, Haiti, located on top of the mountain Bonnet a L’Eveque, approximately south of the city of Cap-Haïtien, southwest of the Three Bays Protected Area, and uphill from the town of Milot. It is one of the largest fortresses in the Americas and was designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as a World Heritage Site in 1982—along with the nearby Sans-Souci Palace. The mountaintop fortress has itself become an icon of Haiti. The Citadel was built by Henri Christophe, a key leader during the Haitian slave rebellion (1791–1804), after Haiti gained independence from France at the beginning of the 19th century. Le Marron Inconnu de Saint-Domingue, shortened as Le Marron Inconnu (, \"The Unknown Slave\"), also called Le Nègre Marron or Nèg Mawon (, \"Maroon Man\"), is a bronze statue of a runaway slave; standing in the center of Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti, it commemorates the abolishment of slavery. Designed and executed by Haitian sculptor and architect Albert Mangonès (1917–2002), it was completed on 22 September 1967. The sculpture serves as a reminder of the call to rebellion in the colony of Saint-Domingue against slave-holding France in 1791. Situated across from the National Palace, it has become the nation's iconic symbol of freedom, and is viewed across the world as a symbol for the freedom of black people. El Toboso is famous for appearing in the novel \"Don Quixote\" by the Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes, as the town in which the fictional character Dulcinea lives. The town also appears in Graham Greene's tribute \"Monsignor Quixote\", where the heroes are a priest (supposedly a descendant of Cervantes's character), and the recently deposed Communist mayor of the town in the post-Franco era.

She was known for her powerful voice and her rhythm-centric musical style. She was the most popular Latin artist of the 20th century, gaining twenty-three gold albums during her career. US President Bill Clinton awarded her the National Medal of Arts in 1994. She was renowned internationally as the \"Queen of Salsa\", \"La Guarachera de Cuba\", as well as The Queen of Latin Music. \n",

            "passage:  \"Disaster\" is a song recorded by British rapper Dave featuring British rapper J Hus, released as the fourth single from Dave's debut studio album \"Psychodrama\". The song was written by Dave, J Hus and Ikeoluwa Oladigbolu (aka TSB), and produced by iO, TSB, Fraser T. Smith, and Dave. The song features an interpolation of Lauryn Hill's \"Mystery of Iniquity.\" Kanye originally attempted to acquire legal clearance to sample the recording but due to various complications, the permission was withheld. West then called upon Syleena Johnson to re-sing the relevant vocal portions of \"Mystery of Iniquity\" which ended up in the final track. The version of the song with the original sample can be heard on West's Freshman Adjustment mixtape. However, the earliest version of the song can be found on West's 2001 mixtape The Prerequisite, on which it called \"Dream Come True\". Lyrically, \"All Falls Down\" examines the self-consciousness and insecurity within society, particularly the black community, and how these characteristics pertain to economic materialism. \"Apologize\" (also spelled \"Apologise\" internationally) is the debut single written by OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder for OneRepublic's debut album \"Dreaming Out Loud\".

Rizvi garnered further success with strong sales of his debut album \"From Under the Bleachers\" from which the single \"Glory of Love\" rose to the 73rd spot on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 charts. Several songs on \"From Under the Bleachers\" touched on controversial subject matter which created a social media storm and helped him climb to the top of Billboard's social media charts at #1 in 2012. On 23 October 2017, Walker released a trailer for the single. Described as \"an action-packed adventure of epic proportion\" and \"a real roller coaster affair\" by critics, it features a variety of subplots, including romance, kidnapping, cult-like burials, \"an Alan Walker-branded time capsule and explosions\", as well as \"flaming torches, desert landscapes, welded metal and a digital timer\". On 25 October 2017, Walker revealed features on the song via social media. John Howard Jones (born 23 February 1955) is an English singer, musician and songwriter.

            "passage:  A man (Geoffrey Rush) wanders through a heavy rainstorm finding his way into a restaurant. The restaurant's employees try to determine if he needs help. Despite his manic mode of speech being difficult to understand, Sylvia learns that his name is David Helfgott and that he is staying at a local hotel. She returns him to the hotel, and despite his attempts to engage her with his musical knowledge and ownership of various musical scores, she leaves. The most famous recorded version was performed in 1934 by Ray Noble and his Orchestra with an uncredited Al Bowlly on vocals. A foxtrot-tempo ballad, the song is considered one of Bowlly's \"outstanding\" vocal efforts. This version was used in the ballroom scene as well as in the closing of Stanley Kubrick's 1980 horror film \"The Shining\", a movie which was evoked by the same song in 2005 comedy-drama \"Colour Me Kubrick\" and the 2013 and 2018 thrillers \"Snowpiercer\" and \"The Outsider\". It is also the closing theme for \"The John Batchelor Show\" and \"The Last Podcast on the Left\". \"Blinded by the Light\" is a song written and recorded by Bruce Springsteen which first appeared on his 1973 debut album Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.. A cover by British rock band Manfred Mann's Earth Band reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States in February 1977 and was also a top ten hit in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada. The ceremony was marked by Marlon Brando's boycott of the Oscars and his sending of Sacheen Littlefeather to explain why he would not show up to collect his Best Actor award for \"The Godfather\", and by Charlie Chaplin's only competitive Oscar win for Best Original Dramatic Score for his 20-year-old film \"Limelight\", which was eligible because it did not screen in Los Angeles until 1972. Chaplin had received honorary Academy Awards in 1929 and 1972. It was later recorded by jazz and jazz influenced artists such as The California Ramblers (their version was very popular in 1924), Louis Armstrong (recorded March 9, 1931 for Okeh Records, catalog No. 41486), Ella Fitzgerald (recorded November 19, 1936 for Decca Records - catalog. No. 1062), Benny Goodman, Harry James, and Frankie Laine (1947 and 1957 - the 1947 version reached No. 9 in the Billboard charts), usually without the explanatory introduction. Golden Throats is Rhino Records' series of humorous compilations of critically lambasted cover versions of songs, performed mostly either by celebrities known for something other than musical talent or musicians not known for the genre from which the song they are covering comes. For example, William Shatner sings (or, more precisely, does a dramatic reading of the lyrics to) \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\" Leonard Nimoy sings \"If I Had a Hammer,\" and Muhammad Ali sings \"Stand by Me.\" Other examples include the Bing Crosby cover of the Beatles' \"Hey Jude\" and the Mel Tormé cover of Donovan's \"Sunshine Superman,\" as both were rock songs being covered by musicians of an older generation. In most cases, the songs appear to be performed sincerely, rather than in a spirit of irony or intentional goofiness. In many respects, these albums were among the first to anthologize lounge music, with their focus on \"light\" versions of contemporary hits. The series (of four albums) was created and produced by long-time Rhino staffer Gary Peterson and pop culture historian Pat Sierchio. Each release contained liner notes penned by acclaimed music historian Irwin Chusid, and most featured original art by Drew Friedman. The cover art parodied well-known albums (\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", \"Their Satanic Majesties Request\", \"Sweetheart Of The Rodeo\", and the Beatles' infamous \"butcher\" cover for \"Yesterday And Today\"). The notoriety of the series no doubt contributed to William Shatner's decision to relaunch his musical career. Rasch was born in Toledo, Ohio. He won a posthumous Oscar in 1972 for Best Original Music Score for Chaplin's 1952 film \"Limelight\" (along with Charlie Chaplin and Larry Russell). The ceremony opened with a song-and-dance medley performed by Gwen Verdon, Paula Kelly, Helen Gallagher and Donna McKechnie. The film was substantially re-edited by its executive producers, Mark Damon and Rebecca De Mornay, and the original score – by Cox's longtime collaborators Pray for Rain – was replaced by a jazz score. Cox requested that his name be removed from the credits. The Weeknd was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2016 for his song Earned It for the , but lost to the British vocalist Sam Smith, who won for his \"Spectre\" theme song \"Writing's on the Wall\". \n",

He is a three-time major winner and the 2015 FedEx Cup champion. In April 2016, \"Time\" magazine named Spieth to its list of the \"100 Most Influential People\", noting that he \"exemplifies everything that's great about sports.\"  Phil Mickelson won the tournament on the first playoff hole; it was his first tour victory in over 4½ years, since The Open Championship in 2013. The 2014 Masters Tournament was the 78th edition of the Masters Tournament, the first of golf's four major championships in 2014. It was held April 10–13 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. Bubba Watson won his second Masters, three shots ahead of runners-up Jonas Blixt and Jordan Spieth; defending champion Adam Scott tied for fourteenth place. After world number one Tiger Woods withdrew, three entered Augusta with a chance to leave with the top ranking. Adam Scott needed a two-way tie for third, Henrik Stenson a two-way tie for second, and Jason Day a win. The trio finished T-14, T-14, and T-20, respectively, so Woods remained number one. Martin Kaymer opened with a 63, led after each round, and won his first Players, one stroke ahead of runner-up Jim Furyk. It was the first to feature an eight-figure purse, with a winner's share of $1.8 million. Kevin Kisner, runner-up in 2018, defeated 2013 champion Matt Kuchar in the final, 3 & 2.

Pierre-François \"David\" Beauchard (born 9 February 1959), who uses the pen name David B., is a French comic book artist and writer, and one of the founders of L'Association. Jean-Christophe Menu (; born August 23, 1964) is a French underground cartoonist, graphic designer, comics scholar and publisher, son of the Egyptologist Bernadette Menu. He is best known for being one of the founders of L'Association, an influential comic book and art book publishing company from France often regarded as one of the key figures in the independent comic movement around the world. Chad Kroski is an author, playwright, and singer. He was created for a German commercial by T-Mobile for its web'n'walk service. Since the launch of the advert, many unofficial websites have popped up to propagate various stories about Kroski (see unofficial biography below), most of them differing from T-Mobile's official fictional biography, found on their in character homepage for the character. John \"Herbert\" Silverbird is a fictional character in the animated television series Family Guy. He is voiced by Mike Henry, who also designed the character. Herbert is a World War II veteran who is an elderly neighbor of the Griffin family. He first appeared in the season 3 episode \"To Love and Die in Dixie\". He is attracted to young boys, and harbors unrequited love for underage teenager Chris Griffin, though most other citizens of Quahog are oblivious to his sexuality. Henry defines Herbert as a pedophile, although speaking in clinical terms this is not the case. \"The Ricky Gervais Show\" is a cartoon series produced for and broadcast by HBO. The series is an animated version of the popular British audio podcasts and audiobooks of the same name, which feature Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant (creators of \"The Office\" and \"Extras\"), along with colleague and friend Karl Pilkington, talking about various subjects behind the microphone. The TV show consists of past audio recordings of these unscripted \"pointless conversations,\" with animation drawn in a style similar to classic era Hanna-Barbera cartoons, presenting jokes and situations in a literal context. The animated \"Ricky Gervais Show\" has aired three 13-episode seasons since it premiered in the United States on February 19, 2010. The second season started on January 14, 2011, and a third season began airing in April 2012.

He is the creator, host, and co-writer of \"The Eric Andre Show\" on Adult Swim, played Mike on the FXX series \"Man Seeking Woman\", and voiced Azizi in the 2019 live action remake of \"The Lion King.\" The campaign centers on the eponymous \"Man Your Man Could Smell Like\", played by actor Isaiah Mustafa (Old Spice refers to him as \"Old Spice Man\") addressing the viewer in confident, rapid-fire monologues which promote the benefit of using Old Spice products. While reciting the monologues, Mustafa progresses through various activities, locations, costumes, and extraordinary situations, all in one uninterrupted take while maintaining constant eye-contact with the camera in a nonchalant demeanor. The advertisements typically feature a surprise ending. Gérard D. Laflaque made his television debut in the early 1980s as a latex puppet. Nowadays, like the show’s other characters, he was created using CGI animation. His name was inspired by former minister and acting leader of the Quebec Liberal Party Gérard D. Levesque. The program follows two storylines. The first involves Laflaque’s family life with his wife Georgette, his son Marcel and his Asian girlfriend Laurence, his insufferable father Pépère, his dog Tarzan, and his next-door neighbour, a gay inventor named Edmond. A caricature of reporter Louise Cousineau recently joined the cast as a recurring character who owns a corner store. As part of the second storyline, Laflaque picked apart the news of the day with no holds barred on a current affairs show accompanied by his cameramen Roger and Henri (later replaced by a man who is part of numerous religions), his producer Paulo, the lovely Sarah-Laurie Joly, and the puppet Ti-Bas. A later arrival was a caricature of intellectual Denise Bombardier. Robert Lachenay (1930–2005) was a French film critic and film crew member. He was François Truffaut's childhood friend and the inspiration for the character \"René Bigey\" in the first two films of the Antoine Doinel film series. \n",

            "passage:  The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Jim (John Krasinski) convinces Dwight (Rainn Wilson) that the building is unsafe, leading to Dwight renting a bus and setting up the office inside. Meanwhile, Nellie (Catherine Tate) asks for Andy's (Ed Helms) help in adopting a baby. Jim tries to make Pam (Jenna Fischer) happy with some pie. Alex Borstein voices Lois Griffin, Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa, Loretta Brown and Lois' mother Barbara Pewterschmidt. Borstein was asked to provide a voice for the pilot while she was working on MADtv. She had not met MacFarlane or seen any of his artwork and said it was \"really sight unseen\". At the time, Borstein performed in a stage show in Los Angeles, in which she played a redhead mother whose voice she had based on one of her cousins. The voice was originally slower (and deeper for the original series), but when MacFarlane heard it, he replied \"Make it a little less fucking annoying ... and speed it up, or every episode will last four hours.\" Alison Bechdel ( ; born September 10, 1960) is an American cartoonist. Originally best known for the long-running comic strip \"Dykes to Watch Out For\", she came to critical and commercial success in 2006 with her graphic memoir \"Fun Home\", which was subsequently adapted as a musical and won a Tony Award for Best Musical in 2015. In 2012, she released her second graphic memoir \"Are You My Mother?\" She's a 2014 recipient of the MacArthur \"Genius\" Award. She is also known for the Bechdel test. The episode was written by Gary Janetti and directed by Michael Dante DiMartino. It received praise from television critic Ahsan Haque for its storyline and use of cultural references. The episode featured guest performances by Butch Hartman, Rachael MacFarlane, Dick Van Patten, Mary Scheer, Joey Slotnick and Wally Wingert, along with several recurring voice actors for the series. \"Day of the Jackanapes\" was written by Al Jean and directed by Michael Marcantel and features recurring guest star Kelsey Grammer as Sideshow Bob, as well as Gary Coleman as himself. It features references to Johnny Carson, \"Bookends\" and \"\", among other things. It would also feature a parody of the song \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\", but because the series' staff were not able to clear the rights for the song in time for the episode's broadcast, the song remained unreleased until 2007. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 9 million viewers, finishing in 34th place in the ratings the week it aired. Following its broadcast, the episode received positive reviews from critics. The series, loosely based on creator Chris Henchy's relationship with wife Brooke Shields, begins on that chance meeting. Patrick Owen (David Sutcliffe), a down-to-earth and dedicated high school teacher, grabs a cup of coffee with his best friend and fellow teacher Stevie (Danny Comden), when he's bitten by a dog. The owner of the dog is famous movie star Alex Young (Teri Polo). Over her apologies, Patrick recognizes Alex and makes light of the situation. Before leaving, Alex gives Patrick her phone number so he can contact her for any medical costs incurred.  SuperNews! is a half-hour, satirical animated television series which aired on Current TV. It was created by Josh Faure-Brac who also wrote for the show and performed the majority of male voices. The show is primarily based on popular culture satire and political humor. Frequent characters include animated interpretations of such mainstream figures as President of the United States Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Senator John McCain, and various pop-culture icons and celebrities such as Lindsay Lohan, Perez Hilton, and Britney Spears. The series follows the misadventures of Harvey A. Kavanaugh (Harvey Korman), an egotistical, self-centered out-of-work actor who operates an acting class from his home that he shares with his level-headed daughter Maggie (Christine Lahti), who works at the Friendly Community Bank. The supporting cast includes Barry Van Dyke as Stuart Stafford, Maggie's boyfriend and co-worker (whom Harvey dislikes), and Milton Selzer as Jake Winkleman, Harvey's hard-working agent. Meg! (with the exclamation mark) is a comic strip by Greg Curfman and distributed by United Feature Syndicate. The main characters are Meg, an elementary-age soccer player, her little brother Mike (victim of Meg's pranks), their parents, and Meg's friend Ashley.

Written by Lizzie and Wendy Molyneux, the episode sees Bob Belcher (H. Jon Benjamin) reluctantly agree to rent out his wife Linda (John Roberts) and their children Tina (Dan Mintz), Gene (Eugene Mirman), and Louise (Kristen Schaal) to the family's landlord Calvin Fischoeder (guest voiced by Kevin Kline), who wants them to pose as his own family to impress a former flame named Shelby (Lindsey Stoddart) at Thanksgiving dinner.

            "passage:  Chef Jerome McElroy is a cartoon character on the Comedy Central series \"South Park\" who was voiced by Isaac Hayes. A cafeteria worker at the local elementary school in the town of South Park, Colorado, Chef is generally portrayed as more level-headed than the other adult residents of the town, and sympathetic to the children. His guidance is often sought by the show's core group of child protagonists —Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick — as he is usually the only adult whom they consistently trust. To an inadvertent fault, he frequently gives inappropriate advice, usually in the non sequitur form of a lascivious soul song. Not Today, Thank You is a British radio comedy featured on BBC Radio 4. It stars Harry Shearer (known for the \"Simpsons\" and \"This Is Spinal Tap\") as Nostrils, a man convinced that he is extremely unattractive, and Brian Hayes as Brian Hughes, an aging radio presenter who tries to broadcast his radio show from his grandmother's basement before being met by a TV producer.  The episode was written by Gary Janetti and directed by Michael Dante DiMartino. It received praise from television critic Ahsan Haque for its storyline and use of cultural references. The episode featured guest performances by Butch Hartman, Rachael MacFarlane, Dick Van Patten, Mary Scheer, Joey Slotnick and Wally Wingert, along with several recurring voice actors for the series. The episode was written by Steve Callaghan and directed by Dominic Polcino. It received mostly mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references, in addition to creating controversy, as many Hurricane Katrina evacuees complained over their city being portrayed as an \"Atlantis\" in the episode. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 8.05 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Barclay DeVeau, Roy Scheider and Wally Wingert, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. Da Ali G Show is a British satirical television series created by and starring English comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. In the series, Baron Cohen plays three unorthodox journalists — faux-streetwise poseur Ali G, Kazakh reporter Borat Sagdiyev, and gay Austrian fashion enthusiast Brüno Gehard. These characters conduct real interviews with unsuspecting people, many of whom are celebrities, high-ranking government officials, and other well-known figures, during which they are asked absurd and ridiculous questions. John Michael Higgins (born February 12, 1963) is an American actor, voice actor and comedian whose film credits include Christopher Guest's mockumentaries, the role of David Letterman in HBO's \"The Late Shift\" and a starring role in the American version of \"Kath & Kim\". He portrayed Peter Lovett in the TV Land original sitcom \"Happily Divorced\" and provided the voice of Iknik Blackstone Varrick in \"The Legend of Korra\". He also starred in the NBC sitcom \"Great News\" as Chuck Pierce for 2 seasons. He currently hosts the game show \"America Says\". He was nominated for a 2019 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host. A successful weatherman at a Chicago news program, David Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is well paid but garners little respect from people in the area who throw fast food at him, David suspects, because they're resentful of how easy his high-paying job is. Dave also feels overshadowed by his father, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Spritzel (Michael Caine), who is disappointed in Dave's apparent inability to grow up and deal with his two children. The situation worsens when Robert is diagnosed with lymphoma and given only a few months to live. As he becomes more and more depressed, Dave takes up archery, finding the activity a way to build his focus and calm his nerves. Seth MacFarlane voices four of the show's main characters: Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, Stewie Griffin, and Glenn Quagmire. MacFarlane chose to voice these characters himself, believing it would be easier to portray the voices he had already envisioned than for someone else to attempt it. MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. Stewie's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, especially his performance in the 1964 musical drama film My Fair Lady. MacFarlane uses his own voice while portraying Brian. The campaign centers on the eponymous \"Man Your Man Could Smell Like\", played by actor Isaiah Mustafa (Old Spice refers to him as \"Old Spice Man\") addressing the viewer in confident, rapid-fire monologues which promote the benefit of using Old Spice products. While reciting the monologues, Mustafa progresses through various activities, locations, costumes, and extraordinary situations, all in one uninterrupted take while maintaining constant eye-contact with the camera in a nonchalant demeanor. The advertisements typically feature a surprise ending. David R. Thorne (born 23 February 1972) is an Australian humourist, satirist, and Internet personality. His work has been featured on the BBC, the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", and \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\". Thorne gained public recognition in late 2008 for an email exchange in which he attempts to pay an overdue bill with a drawing of a seven-legged spider. The exchange spread virally via email and social networking sites, leading to a surge of visitors to his website 27b/6 (27bslash6). 27b/6 features a collection of humorous emails and articles from Thorne's life. These and additional essays appear in Thorne's book, \"The Internet is a Playground\". Published by Penguin Group and released on 28 April 2011, the book debuted at number four on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list. \n",

            "passage:  United achieved their highest points total and league placing since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013, amassing 81 points to finish second in the Premier League. However, despite winning three cups the previous season, the club failed to secure silverware this time around, also finishing as runners-up in both the UEFA Super Cup and FA Cup. United also suffered disappointing exits in both the EFL Cup and Champions League, bowing out to Bristol City and Sevilla respectively by 2–1 scorelines. Throughout the season, despite having a wealth of attacking options and completing the signing of Alexis Sánchez in January, manager José Mourinho was criticised by sections of the media and a section of United supporters for a perceived negative playing style. Zenit won the match 2–1, Pavel Pogrebnyak scoring just before half-time, before Danny doubled the Russians' lead just before the hour mark. Nemanja Vidić reduced the deficit to one goal in the 73rd minute, but it was not enough to wrest the trophy from Zenit's grasp, as they became the first Russian team to win the competition. The sending-off of Paul Scholes for handball in the 90th minute resulted in him missing Manchester United's opening game in their defence of the Champions League, a home tie against Villarreal. In October 2007, Arsenal equalled the UEFA Champions League record victory with a 7–0 win over Slavia Prague at the Emirates Stadium. The record was broken the following month when Liverpool defeated Beşiktaş 8–0 at Anfield. All four English clubs competing in the Champions League reached the quarter-finals, resulting in three all-English ties during the competition's latter stages. Liverpool eliminated Arsenal in the quarter-finals, but lost the semi-final to Chelsea, who went on to meet Manchester United in the final in Moscow. United completed the European Double, winning the Premier League two points ahead of Chelsea and winning the UEFA Champions League, again against Chelsea 6–5 on penalties (1–1 after extra time) to lift the European Cup for the third time. This was a unique occurrence – the first time two English clubs had met in the final of the European Cup/Champions League. It was also a repeat of the opening game of the season, the FA Community Shield, which also finished 1–1 and saw a United win on penalties, 3–0. The final was played on 21 May 2008 at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, where Manchester United played against Chelsea, making it an all-English final for the first time in the history of the European Cup. Manchester United won the match 6–5 on penalties, following a 1–1 draw after extra time. The UEFA Celebration Match was a football match played on 13 March 2007 as a celebration of both the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which laid the foundations for the European Union, and the 50th year of Manchester United's participation in UEFA competitions. Representatives felt it would be more appropriate to celebrate the landmark using a football match rather than another form of celebration. A Europe XI managed by Italian World Cup-winning manager Marcello Lippi played against Manchester United at Old Trafford, Manchester. The match was televised live on BBC Three in the United Kingdom and also streamed live via the BBC Online website. The £1.25 million raised went towards the Manchester United Foundation. The match was officiated by German referee Markus Merk. Born in Zadar, Modrić's childhood coincided with the Croatian War of Independence which displaced his family. In 2002, he was signed by Dinamo Zagreb at age 16, after showing promise with his hometown club's youth team. He continued his development in Zagreb before spells on loan to Zrinjski Mostar and Inter Zaprešić. He made his debut for Dinamo in 2005 and won three consecutive league titles and domestic cups, being named the Prva HNL Player of the Year in 2007. In 2008, he moved to Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur for a club-record transfer fee of £16.5 million, where he led Spurs to their first UEFA Champions League appearance in almost 50 years, reaching the quarter-finals of the 2010–11 tournament. The 2007 FA Cup Final was played on Saturday, 19 May 2007 between Chelsea and Manchester United. It was the 126th FA Cup Final and the first to be played at the new Wembley Stadium. Manchester United suffered a 1–0 defeat to Chelsea by Didier Drogba's extra time goal, completing a domestic cup double for the Blues in the 2006–07 season, as they had already won the League Cup Final in February. United were favourite for playing a double of their own as they had recently beaten Chelsea to the Premier League title two weeks earlier. The game was widely considered to be a disappointment by pundits and fans alike. As a result of Manchester United and Chelsea having already been guaranteed qualification for the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Cup entry for the FA Cup winner/runner-up went instead to the highest positioned Premier League team who had not already qualified for Europe: Bolton Wanderers. The match, which was contested by Zenit Saint Petersburg of Russia and Rangers of Scotland, was billed as a battle between former Rangers manager Dick Advocaat, then the manager of Zenit, and incumbent Rangers boss Walter Smith, both of whom had completed the Scottish domestic treble; Smith in 1993, Advocaat in 1999. On 21 January, a Piper PA-46 Malibu light aircraft transporting Cardiff's recently transferred-in player Emiliano Sala was crashed off Alderney, in the Channel Islands. The aircraft had been travelling from Nantes, France, to Cardiff. The wreckage of the aircraft was found thirteen days later. He was confirmed dead on 7 February. Two days before the tragedy, Sala was presented as a Cardiff player but had not decided on his shirt number at that time. Cardiff and Nantes are in dispute over the payment of the transfer fee for Sala. English manager Bill Nicholson led Tottenham Hotspur to victory in the inaugural final of the contest in all-English encounter against Wolverhampton Wanderers. For the first 25 years of the competition, the final was contested over two legs, one at each participating club's stadium, but in 1998, Luigi Simoni led Internazionale to victory over Lazio in the competition's first single-legged final held at a neutral venue, the Parc des Princes in Paris. \n",

The All-Liga ACB Team  is an award for the top-tier professional basketball league in Spain, the Spanish ACB League. It is the yearly selection of the league's top 10 basketball players by position. The award began with the 2003–04 season. The award is voted on by coaches, players, fans (through online voting), and the media. La Liga's all-time top goalscorer is Lionel Messi, who also holds the record for most goals scored in a season with 50 goals in 2011-12. Athletic Bilbao's Telmo Zarra, who was the competition's all-time top scorer until 2014, was top scorer in six seasons between 1945 and 1953. Four other players—Lionel Messi, Real Madrid's Alfredo Di Stéfano, Quini of Sporting de Gijón and Barcelona, and Hugo Sánchez of Atlético Madrid and Real Madrid—each finished as top scorer in five seasons. Most assists provided in tournament's history Since the UEFA Champions League's formation at the start of the 1992–93 season, a total of 39 players have managed to make at least 100 appearances in the competition. The first player to hit the landmark was Raúl, who did so in February 2006 while the most recent member of the \"100 club\" is Toni Kroos, who played his 100th match in October 2019. The player with the most appearances is Iker Casillas, who has played 177 times in the Champions League. The Castrol performance index is a ranking system created by Castrol for men's club association football as part of a sponsorship package with FIFA. The system uses mathematical formulas which evaluate various player performance in terms of how individual actions either assist or prevent goals. The system takes into account the strength of the opposition and the time in a game the player's actions occurred. In basketball, points are the sum of the score accumulated through free throws or field goals. The ACB's scoring title is awarded to the player with the highest points per game average in a given regular season.

The video made a buzz the day after the announcement of the president and went viral. Netizens used a hashtag #Yetnahaw_Ga3. This is the most common slogan in all the events. It has been used on banners since March 2019 and the local and international media often mention it to report on the events in Algeria. Carmen Gloria Quintana Arancibia (born c. 1968) is a Chilean woman who suffered severe burns in an incident where she and other young people were detained by an army patrol during a street demonstration against the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. She survived, and thereafter became a symbol of hope for democracy in Chile to many, receiving an embrace and encouragement from Pope John Paul II. Mandembo and three other members of the DR Congo delegation to the London Olympics were reported missing on 13 August 2012, the day after the closing ceremony. In 2009, one of the authors of Charter '08, Liu Xiaobo, was sentenced to eleven years' imprisonment for \"inciting subversion of state power\" because of his involvement. A year later, Liu was awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize by the Norwegian Nobel Committee. Seven years later in July 2017, he died of terminal liver cancer in the prison after having been granted medical parole. Arturo Pérez de Alejo Rodríguez (1951 – 25 January 2017) was a Cuban dissident and had been declared as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. Fujimori has been mentioned as being involved in the Odebrecht scandal and on 31 October 2018, after seven days of considering the positions of Prosecutor José Domingo Pérez and Keiko Fujimori's defense team, Judge Richard Concepción Carhuancho sentenced her to 36 months of preventive prison, as part of an investigation of her alleged role as leader of a criminal organization within her political party \"Fuerza Popular\", and money laundering allegations of at least one million dollars involving Odebrecht, surrounding her 2011 presidential campaign. In 2016, Salguero pleaded guilty to multiple corruption charges, as he admitted accepting a bribe in return for his vote for the 2018 World Cup. After spending three years under house arrest, he was eventually fined 100,000 CHF and banned from FIFA for 7 years. On 5 August, the day of the 2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, police in Rio de Janeiro arrested two people for attempted illegal resale of hundreds of tickets allocated to the Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI). The scandal precipitated the dramatic arrest of OCI president Pat Hickey, while in a hotel room assigned to his son. Hickey immediately resigned, as well as relinquishing his membership of the International Olympic Committee, his role as president of the European Olympic Committees and his role as vice-president of the Association of National Olympic Committees. Hermínio da Palma Inácio (1922, Lagoa, Faro District – 2009) was a Portuguese revolutionary against the Salazar dictatorship. Famously, he hijacked an airplane in Morocco, forced it to fly over Lisbon dropping leaflets calling for free elections. He then allowed the plane to return to Morocco, apologized to the passengers, presented all the ladies on board with a rose, and then vanished.  Capital punishment in Canada dates back to Canada's earliest history, including its period as a French colony and, after 1763, its time as a British colony. From 1867 to the elimination of the death penalty for murder on July 14, 1976, 1,481 people had been sentenced to death, and 710 had been executed. Of those executed, 697 were men and 13 were women. The only method used in Canada for capital punishment of civilians after the end of the French regime was hanging. The last execution in Canada was the double hanging of Arthur Lucas and Ronald Turpin on December 11, 1962, at Toronto's Don Jail. \n",

            "passage:  Liverpool clinched the First Division title just two seasons after winning promotion, finishing four points ahead of runners-up Manchester United while defending champions Everton finished third.  Bye: Tottenham Hotspur , Motor Zwickau , Linfield F.C.  The 1963–64 FA Cup was the 83rd staging of the world's oldest football cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup, commonly known as the FA Cup. West Ham United won the competition for the first time (despite having reached the 1923 final), beating Preston North End 3–2 in the final at Wembley. Due to fixture congestion, the second leg was not played until after the start of the 1961–2 season. As a result, Villa began their defence of the trophy just eight days after winning it. Though all League clubs were eligible to participate, Arsenal, Sheffield Wednesday, West Bromwich Albion, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur, did not enter. The prize money for winning the competition was £750. The two clubs would not play each other again until they met in the same competition in August 2013. Both clubs received first round byes. The 1967–68 European Cup was the 13th European Cup, UEFA's premier club football tournament. The competition was won by Manchester United, who beat Benfica 4–1 in the final at Wembley Stadium, London. The European Cup title marked the tenth year since the Munich air disaster, in which eight United players were killed and their manager, Matt Busby, was left close to death, the day after earning a place in the semi-finals of the 1957–58 competition. It was also the first time an English side had won the trophy. Despite fielding nine internationals United had struggled during the season while their opponents City had performed well, doing the league double over United in the process and thus entered the final as slight favourites. The importance of televised coverage came to the fore this year as the two sides tossed for choice of colours despite traditionally wearing red and blue shirts respectively. Those colours would look identical to the viewers on their black and white televisions so Leicester, having lost the toss switched to white. West Ham, captained by Bobby Moore and managed by Ron Greenwood, won the match 3–2 to win the FA Cup for the first time. Second Division Preston led twice through Doug Holden and Alex Dawson respectively, with John Sissons and Geoff Hurst equalising for West Ham. Ronnie Boyce then scored the winner for the London club in the 90th minute. The first leg took place on 23 May 1963 at Birmingham's home ground, St Andrew's. Birmingham took the lead when Harris fed Auld who crossed for Ken Leek's powerful shot, but Aston Villa equalised via Bobby Thomson. Seven minutes into the second half, the same combination of players made it 2–1, and after 66 minutes Jimmy Bloomfield met a Harris cross to score off the post to give Birmingham a 3–1 lead. The 1963 FA Charity Shield was the 41st FA Charity Shield, an annual football match held between the winners of the previous season's Football League and FA Cup competitions. The match was contested by Everton who had won the 1962–63 Football League, and Manchester United, who had won the 1962–63 FA Cup, at Goodison Park, Liverpool, on 17 August 1963. Everton won the match 4–0, with goals from Jimmy Gabriel, Dennis Stevens, Derek Temple and a penalty from Roy Vernon. United achieved their highest points total and league placing since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013, amassing 81 points to finish second in the Premier League. However, despite winning three cups the previous season, the club failed to secure silverware this time around, also finishing as runners-up in both the UEFA Super Cup and FA Cup. United also suffered disappointing exits in both the EFL Cup and Champions League, bowing out to Bristol City and Sevilla respectively by 2-1 scorelines. Throughout the season, manager José Mourinho was criticised by sections of the media and a small section of United supporters for a perceived negative playing style, this despite having a wealth of attacking options and completing the signing of Alexis Sánchez in January. \n",

            "passage:  Jackson played four years of college soccer at Grand Canyon University between 2014 and 2017. He was coached his first year by Petar Draksin at GCU and the following three seasons by Schellas Hyndman. During his time with the Antelopes, Jackson scored 41 goals and tallied 9 assists in 69 appearances. He was the program's second ever MLS SuperDraft pick after teammate Amir Šašivarević went one round earlier in the same draft. Bobby Jackson graduated from Salisbury High School in 1992. He attended Western Nebraska Community College and the University of Minnesota before being selected by the Seattle SuperSonics with the 23rd pick in the 1997 NBA draft. As a Golden Gopher, Bobby Jackson led Minnesota to the Final Four, where they lost to the Kentucky Wildcats. He was traded to the Denver Nuggets prior to his rookie season where he played 68 games before moving on to a more familiar place in Minnesota where he donned a Timberwolves jersey for two seasons. He had his best years in Sacramento where he played for the Kings from 2000 to 2005 where he was known as \"Action Jackson\" and a crowd favorite. A former Sixth Man award winner, Jackson suffered an abdominal strain early in the 2004–05 season that forced him to miss 51 games. Arseneault in 1989 inherited a Grinnell program that had not had a winning season in 25 years. After a couple years of trying out traditional eight-player rotations, he felt Grinnell needed to change its basketball philosophy to rejuvenate the team and have more fun. Grinnell was a Division III school that did not offer athletic scholarships, and players that did not receive playing time were quitting. Arseneault developed the Grinnell System, which incorporated a dozen or more players in a game. According to his son, David Jr., who also played and later coached under his father at Grinnell, Arseneault did not believe the system would be a competitive strategy, but thought the increased scoring would develop a more positive environment, even if the team lost. Through 2012, Grinnell won five conference championships, advanced to the postseason 11 times, and led the nation in scoring at all levels of college basketball in 17 of the past 19 seasons. Eric Ambrose Gordon Jr. (born December 25, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). In high school, he was named \"Mr. Basketball\" of Indiana during his senior year while playing at North Central High School. He is known, in part, as the subject of a recruiting competition between the University of Illinois and Indiana University in the spring and summer of 2006; because of Gordon's talent and high level of play that year, his recruitment was the subject of media coverage. Choice began his collegiate career at the University of Oklahoma but transferred to Georgia Tech in 2005. Choice played high school football for Lovejoy High School, in Lovejoy, Georgia where he recorded 40 career all-purpose touchdowns. Choice graduated with a degree in History, Technology and Society in December 2007, and earned All-Big 12 Academic Honor Roll in 2004 along with All-ACC Academic Honor Roll in 2005-2006. He signed a two-year, $6 million deal with the Cowboys. After starring at Lahser High School for three years until its closure in 2013, and then in the 2013–14 season at its successor, Bloomfield Hills High School, Maten surprised recruiting experts by selecting Georgia over Indiana and home state school Michigan State. Jaren Jackson Sr. (born October 27, 1967) is an American professional basketball coach and former professional basketball player. A 6'4\" (1.93 m) shooting guard born in New Orleans, Louisiana, Jackson played at Georgetown University from 1985 to 1989 and graduated with a bachelor's degree in finance. He was never drafted into the NBA but played 13 seasons for multiple teams. He is best known for his tenure with the San Antonio Spurs, who he helped win their first NBA championship in 1999. Born in Bristol, Connecticut, Corbat graduated from Harvard University with a B.A. in economics where he also played offensive guard for the school's football team. He was two time all Ivy League and was selected as first team College Football All-America Team in NCAA Division I-AA in 1982. He was the first player to be selected since Dan Jiggetts in 1975. Teske lived in the Grand Rapids, Michigan suburb of Grandville until he was 10 and his family moved to Medina, Ohio. Teske was as a high school freshman and as a sophomore before eclipsing as a junior for Medina High School. Among Teske's advisors on his recruitment was his maternal grandfather, Jim Zuidema. On August 7, 2014, he committed to Michigan via Twitter. Teske signed his National Letters of Intent on November 11, 2015 on the same day as future teammates Austin Davis, Ibi Watson and Xavier Simpson. Simpson, Watson and Teske were all named to the 2015–16 Associated Press Ohio high school Division I boys basketball all-state 1st team. During his collegiate career at USC he wore the famous #55 and was a collegiate All-American and defensive captain of the 1996 Champion Rose Bowl Game. \n",

            "passage:  Robert Paisley OBE (23 January 1919 – 14 February 1996) was an English footballer and manager who spent almost fifty years with Liverpool as a wing half, physiotherapist, coach and manager. Due to his achievements as Liverpool manager, Paisley is regarded as one of the most successful English football managers of all time. Paisley, Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane are the only managers to have won the European Cup three times. During his nine-year tenure as Liverpool manager, Paisley won honours at a rate of 2.2 per season, a rate surpassed only by Pep Guardiola. He is one of five managers to have won the English top-flight championship as both player and manager at the same club, the others being Bill Nicholson (Tottenham Hotspur), Howard Kendall (Everton), George Graham (Arsenal) and Kenny Dalglish (Liverpool), the latter as player/manager. The 1984 Football League Cup Final (billed as the Milk Cup Final) was an association football match between Liverpool and Everton. The initial final was a dour affair in which Liverpool had more chances but Everton saw what seemed a clear-cut penalty claim waved away by the referee when Alan Hansen used his hand to steer Adrian Heath's goal-bound shot off the Liverpool goal line. The replay was equally dour but Liverpool won the game through a first-half Graeme Souness goal at Maine Road. This was Liverpool's fourth consecutive success in the competition and also the third consecutive final in which they had defeated that season's eventual FA Cup winners.  Peter Andrew Beardsley MBE (born 18 January 1961) is an English former footballer who played as a forward or midfielder between 1979 and 1999. In 1987, he set a record transfer fee in the English game and represented his country 59 times between 1986 and 1996, once as captain, taking part in two FIFA World Cups (1986 and 1990) and UEFA Euro 1988. At club level, he played for Newcastle United, Liverpool and Everton, having also had spells with Carlisle United, Manchester United, Vancouver Whitecaps, Bolton Wanderers, Manchester City, Fulham, Hartlepool United and the Melbourne Knights. He was briefly appointed as the caretaker manager of Newcastle United in 2010. The 1965 FA Cup Final was an association football match between Liverpool and Leeds United on 1 May 1965 at Wembley Stadium, London. It was the final match of the 1964–65 FA Cup, the 93rd season of England's primary cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup, better known as the FA Cup. Liverpool were appearing in their third final, they had lost the previous two in 1914 and 1950, while Leeds were appearing in their first. Both teams entered the competition in the third round. The majority of Liverpool's matches were close affairs, they did not score more than two goals in any of their matches and this was also their biggest margin of victory. Leeds' matches ranged from close affairs to comfortable victories. They won their third round tie against Stockport County 3–0, while they beat Manchester United 1–0 in a semi-final replay following a 0–0 draw in the initial match. The 1933 FA Cup Final was a football match between Everton and Manchester City on 29 April 1933 at Wembley Stadium in London. The deciding match of English football's primary cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (better known as the FA Cup), it was the 62nd final, and the 11th at Wembley. The 1933 final was the first where the players, including goalkeepers, were issued numbers for identification. Everton were allocated numbers 1–11 and Manchester City numbers 12–22. Michael Trebilcock (born 29 November 1944 in Gunnislake, Cornwall) is an English retired professional footballer. He played primarily as a winger and is most famous for scoring twice in the 1966 FA Cup Final for Everton, becoming the first black player to score in an FA Cup Final. Trebilcock is described as a \"black mixed heritage player\" by sociologist Mark Christian, who notes that the label of first black Everton player is often wrongly given to Cliff Marshall, \"due to [Trebilcock's] ambiguous black mixed heritage\". The 1966 FA Charity Shield was a Merseyside derby between Liverpool and Everton at Goodison Park. Liverpool won the Football League and Everton won the 1966 FA Cup Final to qualify for the charity shield. Before the game, Roger Hunt, Alan Ball and Ray Wilson paraded the World Cup, the FA Cup and the Football League Trophy around Goodison Park. West Ham began the game brightly, but despite chances at both ends, there was no score at half-time. The breakthrough came in the 70th minute when Ronnie Boyce threaded a pass between two defenders and Alan Sealey scored from a difficult angle. Two minutes later, a free kick to West Ham was not cleared; Bobby Moore crossed the ball, Radenkovic failed to collect the ball and Sealey scored a second goal to seal the match for West Ham. David Robert Joseph Beckham (; born 2 May 1975) is an English former professional footballer, the current president of Inter Miami CF and co-owner of Salford City. He played for Manchester United, Preston North End, Real Madrid, Milan, LA Galaxy, Paris Saint-Germain and the England national team, for which he held the appearance record for an outfield player until 2016. He is the first English player to win league titles in four countries: England, Spain, the United States and France. He retired in May 2013 after a 20-year career, during which he won 19 major trophies. \n",

            "passage:  Bengalized is a term with origins among Cincinnati Bengals football fans and/or players. It usually refers to a Cincinnati Bengals player who, after multiple seasons of poor team performance, develops hostility with the coaching staff or ownership operation, and cultivates pessimism about remaining with the team. This results in efforts by the player to prompt a trade or release from the team. \"Bengalized\" can also refer to a Cincinnati Bengals fan who becomes frustrated after years of futility in losing seasons and/or playoff losses, ultimately ending their support of the franchise. As of the conclusion of the 2017-18 season, the Bengals have had 27 seasons without a playoff win - currently the longest streak in the NFL. The 2018 season was the Cleveland Browns' 70th season as a professional sports franchise, their 66th season as a member of the NFL, and their first full season under general manager John Dorsey. It was their third and final season under head coach Hue Jackson. The Browns improved upon their 2017 campaign in which they went a franchise worst 0–16, finishing in 3rd place in the AFC North with a record of 7–8–1, their best record since the 2007 season. However, they failed to end their franchise-record and league-high 15-year playoff drought and enter the postseason for the first time since 2002. The 2018 season was the Cincinnati Bengals' 49th season in the National Football League, their 51st overall and their 16th and final under head coach Marvin Lewis. The Bengals failed to improve upon their 2017 campaign as they collapsed to a 6–10 finish (after a 4–1 start) to finish in 4th place in the AFC North. This marks the 3rd consecutive season the Bengals have failed to make the playoffs. The Broncos radically changed their logo and uniforms in 1997, a design that the team continues to use to this day. The new logos and uniforms were unveiled on February 4, 1997. Navy blue replaced royal blue on the team's color scheme. The current logo is a profile of a horse's head, with an orange mane and navy blue outlines. The Broncos' popular live animal mascot Thunder was the inspiration to incorporate a horse-head profile as part of the logo on the team's helmets. During a February 4, 1997 press conference introducing the new logo, the team president and the art director for Nike, who were the creators of the new design, described it as \"a powerful horse with a fiery eye and mane.\" The Chief Wahoo logo was last worn by the Indians in an 11–3 loss to the Houston Astros on October 8, 2018 in the 2018 American League Division Series. News outlets noted the irony of the logo's final appearance being on Indigenous Peoples' Day/Columbus Day. One notable effect of the relaunch is that it reaffirmed the importance of the X-Men characters and franchise, which some critics felt had grown isolated and diminished in prestige in light of the success of the Avengers-centered films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a status that some felt was attributed to 20th Century Fox's then-ownership of the feature film rights for the X-Men, before Disney bought the studio on March 2019. The 2017 Cincinnati Reds season was the 148th season for the franchise in Major League Baseball, and their 15th at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. The Reds opened the season with a game against the Philadelphia Phillies on April 3 at the Great American Ball Park and finished the season on October 1 against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. The Reds were eliminated from postseason playoff consideration on September 14, 2017. They equaled their record from the previous season and finished last in their division for the third straight year and missed the playoffs for the fourth straight year. This compromise, which was unprecedented in North American professional sports, has since been cited in franchise moves and agreements in other leagues, including ones in Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, the National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League. The 2017 Cleveland Browns season was the franchise's 69th as a professional sports franchise, their 65th season as a member of the National Football League, their second under head coach Hue Jackson and their second and final season under general manager Sashi Brown. Although the controversial logo Chief Wahoo has been officially removed, the Cleveland Indians remain part of the Native American mascot controversy which has led over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts to publish resolutions or policies that state that any use of Native American names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a harmful form of ethnic stereotyping that promote misunderstanding and prejudice which contributes to other problems faced by Native Americans.  \n",

This results in efforts by the player to prompt a trade or release from the team. \"Bengalized\" can also refer to a Cincinnati Bengals fan who becomes frustrated after years of futility in losing seasons and/or playoff losses, ultimately ending their support of the franchise. As of the conclusion of the 2017-18 season, the Bengals have had 27 seasons without a playoff win - currently the longest streak in the NFL. Since joining the NFL in 1950, the Browns have had 57 different quarterbacks start in at least one game for the team. Pro Football Hall of Fame member Otto Graham led the Browns to three NFL championships in their first six seasons in the league. Since resuming operations in 1999 after a three-year vacancy, the franchise has been notable for its futility at the quarterback position. From 1999 through week 4 of the 2018 season, the team had 30 different players start at quarterback. Tim Couch, the Browns' first overall draft pick in 1999, was the only quarterback to start all 16 games in a season for the team during a 20-season span (1999-2018), having done so in 2001. The Browns had started more than one quarterback in 17 consecutive seasons, until Baker Mayfield started every game in 2019. The event, which is officially known as the \"Player Selection Meeting\", is held each April. The draft is used as the primary means to distribute newly available talent (primarily from college football) equitably amongst the teams. Selections are made in reverse order based on the previous season's record, i.e. the club with the worst record from the previous season selects first. Through 2009, only two exceptions were made to this order: the Super Bowl champion always selects last (32nd), and the Super Bowl loser is awarded the penultimate (31st) pick. Beginning in 2010, teams making the playoffs will be seeded in reverse order depending upon how far they advance. The draft consists of seven rounds. Teams have the option of trading selections for players, cash and/or other selections (including future year selections). Thus, it is not uncommon for a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades. The Steelers have traded away their first-round pick eight times; they have had two first-round selections in two drafts. The Broncos were barely competitive during their 10-year run in the AFL and their first seven years in the NFL. They did not complete a winning season until 1973. In 1977, four years later, they qualified for the playoffs for the first time in franchise history and advanced to Super Bowl XII. Since 1975, the Broncos have become one of the NFL's more successful teams, having suffered only seven losing seasons. They have won eight AFC Championships (1977, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1997, 1998, 2013, 2015, and three Super Bowl championships (1997 (XXXII), 1998 (XXXIII), 2015 (50). However, the Broncos have the NFL record for most Super Bowl losses (5). They have five players in the Pro Football Hall of Fame: John Elway, Floyd Little, Gary Zimmerman, Shannon Sharpe, and the most recently elected member, Terrell Davis. The 2018 season was the Cincinnati Bengals' 49th season in the National Football League, their 51st overall and their 16th and final under head coach Marvin Lewis. The Bengals failed to improve upon their 2017 campaign as they collapsed to a 6–10 finish (after a 4–1 start) to finish in 4th place in the AFC North. This marks the 3rd consecutive season the Bengals have failed to make the playoffs. For the second consecutive year, a team relocated to the Los Angeles metropolitan area, as the former San Diego Chargers announced their intent to do so in January 2017. The 2017 Cleveland Browns season was the franchise's 69th as a professional sports franchise, their 65th season as a member of the National Football League, their second under head coach Hue Jackson and their second and final season under general manager Sashi Brown. In , then-Browns owner Art Modell made the decision to move the team from Cleveland, Ohio to Baltimore, Maryland. An agreement between the city of Cleveland and the NFL kept the team’s history, name and colors in Cleveland, while Modell’s new team would be regarded as an expansion team. The Baltimore Ravens would begin play in 1996, and the Browns would return to the league in . For record-keeping purposes, the Browns are considered to have suspended operations from 1996 to 1998, which is reflected in this list. In 2017, the Cleveland Browns became the second team in NFL history to suffer an 0–16 record. The 2018 season was the Cleveland Browns' 70th season as a professional sports franchise, their 66th season as a member of the NFL, and their first full season under general manager John Dorsey. It was their third and final season under head coach Hue Jackson. The Browns improved upon their 2017 campaign in which they went a franchise worst 0–16, finishing in 3rd place in the AFC North with a record of 7–8–1, their best record since the 2007 season. However, they failed to end their franchise-record and league-high 15-year playoff drought and enter the postseason for the first time since 2002. This compromise, which was unprecedented in North American professional sports, has since been cited in franchise moves and agreements in other leagues, including ones in Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, the National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League. \n",

            "passage:  The game was organized by a group known as the Bowl Championship Series, consisting of the Rose Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, and Orange Bowl, which sought to match the two highest-ranked teams in a championship game to determine the best team in the country at the end of the season. The participating teams were determined by averaging the results of the final weekly Coaches' Poll, the Harris Poll of media, former players and coaches, and the average of six computer rankings. The Coaches' Poll was contractually required to name the winner of the game as its No. 1 team on the final postseason ranking; hence, the AFCA National Championship Trophy was presented to the winning team during a post-game ceremony. The Black and Blue Bowl is the name given to the Memphis–Southern Miss football rivalry between the Tigers of the University of Memphis and the Golden Eagles of the University of Southern Mississippi. The 1873 college football season had no clear-cut champion, with the \"Official NCAA Division I Football Records Book\" listing Princeton as having been selected national champions. The BCS relied on a combination of polls and computer selection methods to determine relative team rankings, and to narrow the field to two teams to play in the BCS National Championship Game held after the other college bowl games (the game rotated among four existing bowl games from the 1998 to 2005 season, and was a separate game from the 2006 to 2013 seasons). The American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) was contractually bound to vote the winner of this game as the BCS National Champion and the contract signed by each conference required them to recognize the winner of the BCS National Championship game as the official and only champion. The BCS was created to end split championships and for the champion to win the title on the field between the two teams selected by the BCS. Big Al is the costumed elephant mascot of the University of Alabama Crimson Tide in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Although LSU began competing in intercollegiate football in 1893, the school's official record book does not generally include full statistics before the 1950s, as records from that period are often inconsistent and incomplete. Records set before then are occasionally included in the lists below if the statistics are available, but they generally are not. Defenders of the current usage often state their intention to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such as fighting spirit and being aggressive, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages. Supporters also claim that the issue is not important, being only about sports, and that the opposition is nothing more than \"political correctness\", which change advocates argue ignores the extensive evidence of harmful effects of stereotypes and bias. Austin Peay has retired two jersey numbers in program history.  Before the 2016 season, the NCAA required that a conference have a minimum of 12 teams and play in two divisions in order to hold a football championship game that did not count against the limit of 12 regular-season games per team.  Historically VMI's biggest rival was Virginia Tech. Today, VMI's biggest rival is The Citadel, as the two teams have battled 72 times, with The Citadel leading the series 40–30–2. The series was dubbed \"The Military Classic of the South\" in 1976 as a reference to the two school's status as the last two remaining all-military schools in the south, a region once rich with military colleges. The winner of each game receives an award known as the \"Silver Shako\", which has rested at The Citadel since 2003. The last contest occurred on November 12, 2016, in which The Citadel rushed for nearly 400 yards en route to a 30–20 victory. In addition to The Citadel, VMI has minor rivalries with William & Mary and Richmond. The Tribe and the Keydets first met in 1908, and William & Mary leads that series 52–33–2. VMI's competition with Richmond goes back farther, to just their third year of existence (1893). Richmond has won 41 games to VMI's 40, and the teams have tied five times. Also, the Keydets have played Virginia and Virginia Tech 82 and 79 times, respectively. \n",

            "passage:  The names of conferences and divisions were changed in 1993 to reflect their geographic locations. Then-new NHL commissioner Gary Bettman made the change to help non-hockey fans better understand the game, as the National Basketball Association, National Football League, and Major League Baseball all use geographic-based names for their conferences and divisions. However, the trophy awarded to the conference champion, the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl, retains some connection to the heritage of the league. In 2005, following the lockout, the league changed the Western Conference logo (along with the Eastern Conference and NHL logos) to its current form. The divisional alignment was adopted at the start of the 2004–05 season, when the now Charlotte Hornets began playing as the NBA's 30th franchise. This necessitated the move of the New Orleans Pelicans from the Eastern Conference's Central Division to the newly created Southwest Division of the Western Conference. The Western Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA) is one of two conferences that makes up the association, the other being the Eastern Conference. Like the Eastern Conference, the Western Conference is made up of 15 teams, organized in three divisions. Trans-National Communications, Inc. was a New York City based Holding company that owned the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association and the Oakland Seals of the National Hockey League. The Western Basketball Association was formed in 1978 and played for one season during 1978–79. Organized by Larry Cregar, a former assistant coach in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and American Basketball Association (ABA), and real estate developer Neil Christianson. Men's college basketball in the Pac-12 Conference began in 1915 with the formation of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC). Principal members of the PCC founded the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU) in 1959, and subsequently went by the names Big Five, Big Six, Pacific-8, and Pacific-10, becoming the Pac-12 in 2011. Competing in the Pac-12 are the Arizona Wildcats, Arizona State Sun Devils, California Golden Bears, Colorado Buffaloes, Oregon Ducks, Oregon State, Stanford Cardinal, UCLA Bruins, USC Trojans, Utah Utes, Washington Huskies, and Washington State Cougars. The predecessor of this league was the Midwest Basketball Conference (MBC) in 1935. It changed its name in 1937 in an attempt to attract a larger audience. The league was created by three corporations: General Electric, Firestone and Goodyear. It was primarily made up of Great Lakes area small-market and corporate teams. The team was established in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a founding member of the Basketball Association of America (BAA). In 1962, the franchise relocated to the Bay Area and was renamed the San Francisco Warriors. In 1971, the team changed its geographic moniker to Golden State, California's state nickname.[c] The team is nicknamed the Dubs as a shortening of \"W's\". The team rosters were limited to 11 players with a nine-man travel squad and a $10,000 standard player salary and $82,000 roster maximum. The completed schedule was 48 games. Bob Cousy of the Boston Celtics began to organize the union in 1954 alongside friend and unofficial agent Joe Sharry. \n",

            "passage:  Justin Louis Thomas (born April 29, 1993) is an American professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour and a former World Number One. In 2017, Thomas experienced a breakout year, winning five PGA Tour events, including the PGA Championship, his maiden major championship, and also winning the FedEx Cup championship. In May 2018, Thomas became the 21st player to top the Official World Golf Ranking. Calvin Peete (July 18, 1943 – April 29, 2015) was an American professional golfer. He was the most successful African-American to have played on the PGA Tour, with 12 wins, prior to the emergence of Tiger Woods. Peete won the 1985 Tournament Players Championship and finished the season top-5 on the PGA Tour money list three times; 1982, 1983 and 1985. Brooks Koepka (, born May 3, 1990) is an American professional golfer on the PGA Tour. In October 2018, he became World Number 1 in the Official World Golf Ranking after winning the 2018 CJ Cup. He won the U.S. Open in 2017 and 2018, and the PGA Championship in 2018 and 2019, becoming the first golfer in history to hold back-to-back titles in two majors simultaneously. He started his career on the European Challenge Tour and eventually the European Tour. He played college golf at Florida State University.  The following is a list of the 20 golfers who have risen to the top of the Official World Golf Ranking. As of January 21, 2018, Dustin Johnson is the number one ranked golfer. Tiger Woods has spent the most consecutive weeks (281) and most total weeks (683) in that position. Three golfers have spent an entire calendar year atop the rankings: Nick Faldo (1993), Greg Norman (1996), and Woods (2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009). Jon Rahm Rodríguez (born 10 November 1994) is a Spanish professional golfer. Rahm was the number one golfer in the World Amateur Golf Ranking for a record 60 weeks and was the low amateur at the 2016 U.S. Open, after which he turned professional. Rahm won three times in 2017, once on the PGA Tour and two Rolex Series event on the European Tour and reached a career-high ranking of No. 2 in the world after winning the CareerBuilder Challenge in January 2018. Jordan Alexander Spieth (born July 27, 1993) is an American professional golfer on the PGA Tour and former world number one in the Official World Golf Ranking. He is a three-time major winner and the 2015 FedEx Cup champion. In April 2016, \"Time\" magazine named Spieth to its list of the \"100 Most Influential People\", noting that he \"exemplifies everything that's great about sports.\"  Tiger Woods won his first major championship, twelve strokes ahead of runner-up Tom Kite. Through 2019, the margin of victory and four-day score of 270 (−18) are tournament records. Woods also became both the youngest (21) and the first non-white player to win at  Ernest W. \"Trip\" Kuehne III (born June 20, 1972) is an American amateur golfer. He is most remembered for his defeat at the hands of Tiger Woods in the 1994 U.S. Amateur, and his subsequent refusal to turn professional in favor of a successful amateur career. Lodewicus Theodorus \"Louis\" Oosthuizen (; born 1982) is a South African professional golfer who won the 2010 Open Championship. He also holds the distinction of finishing runner-up in all four major championships: the 2012 Masters Tournament losing in a sudden death playoff, the 2015 U.S. Open, the 2015 Open Championship where he was defeated in a four-hole aggregate playoff, and the 2017 PGA Championship. He is the seventh golfer to accomplish this feat, joining Craig Wood, Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson, Greg Norman, Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson. His highest placing on the Official World Golf Ranking is fourth which he reached in January 2013. Millard initially qualified for the 2014 U.S. Open, but later disqualified himself over a potential infraction. \n",

Brukman is a textile factory in Balvanera, Buenos Aires, Argentina (Jujuy 554). Currently under the control of a worker cooperative called \"18 de Diciembre\", it is among the most famous of the country's \"recovered factories\". The attack cut a fifth of Kiev, the capital, off power for one hour and is considered to have been a large-scale test.  The Derzhprom or Gosprom (; ) building is a constructivist structure located in Freedom Square, Kharkiv, Ukraine. Its name is an abbreviation of two words that, taken together, mean \"State Industry\". In English the structure is known as the State Industry Building or the Palace of Industry. Location plate shooting took place in Chicago in April 2007. Several chase scenes, including one with a low flying helicopter, were shot in Chicago over two days, on Wacker Drive along the Chicago River, between Columbus Drive and LaSalle Street.The opening scene was filmed using the Carbide & Carbon Building.Production moved to the Czech Republic later in May, scheduled for 12 weeks of shooting, which included a scene in Pernštejn Castle. Using a former sugar factory in Prague, production designer John Myhre constructed a large textile factory as part of an industrial world, the setting of a mythological environment in which looms create fabrics that weavers interpret as assassination orders. Afterward, filming moved to Budapest, then returned to Chicago in August. While the actors performed many of their own stunts, with free running and parkour in some of the action scenes, and Angelina Jolie being actually strapped to the hood of a moving Dodge Viper, some of the especially high-risk sequences required digital doubles instead. Two full-sized train cars were built, a Chicago 'L' for a training scene where Fox and Wesley run atop a train, and a Czech Pendolino for the derailment, which was stationed in a gimbal equipped with hydraulics to allow the car to tilt and roll as the train crashed. The film originally had both an alternate opening and an alternate ending. The alternate opening, a flashback to ancient times describing the history of the Fraternity and the Loom of Fate, is available on the special edition DVD and Blu-ray. Trebišov (; ; ) is a small industrial town in the easternmost part of Slovakia, with a population of around 25,000. The town is an administrative, economic and cultural center with machine (Vagónka) and building materials industries. The Kalinin Plant Production Association produces munitions for the military. It is now involved in large scale conversion from military to civil production. The owner of the Kalugin's factory informed the workers that he will be obliged to close it soon as it is not profitable. The boss, a local oligarch called Kalugin was kidnapped from his car by masked and armed persons who demanded for him a big ransom. The money is taken to the workers by the head of the oligarch personal security team. His heavily armed mercenaries arrive at night at the factory where the boss is being held hostage. The factory was founded in 1874 by Valentin Yefimov. In 1923, it was named after Karl Marx by the Soviet authorities in order to celebrate his 105th anniversary. Petro Poroshenko acquired control over the factory soon after its privatization in the 1990s, making it the basis for the future Roshen Corporation; a major modernization with Western equipment followed. FaSinPat, formerly known as Zanon, is a worker-controlled ceramic tile factory in the southern Argentine province of Neuquén, and one of the most prominent in the recovered factory movement of Argentina.

            "passage:  Commentators wrote positively about the episode, with many applauding the episode's appropriate use of the supporting characters and suspense before the season finale. Upon airing, the episode was watched by 9.72 million viewers and received an 18-49 rating of 2.1, marking season low ratings. Writer Ian Maxtone-Graham was interested in making an episode where the Simpson family travels to New York to retrieve their misplaced car. Executive producers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein suggested that the car be found in Austin J. Tobin Plaza at the World Trade Center, as they wanted a location that would be widely known. Great lengths were taken to make a detailed replica of the borough of Manhattan. The episode received generally positive reviews, and has since been on accolade lists of \"The Simpsons\" episodes. The \"You're Checkin' In\" musical sequence won two awards. Because of the World Trade Center's main role, the episode was taken off syndication in many areas following the September 11 attacks, but had come back into syndication by 2006. Rebecca Pine (Karla Crome) and James \"Big Jim\" Rennie (Dean Norris) hold a census at the diner in order to determine how to apportion resources. When the Dome begins to produce red rain that burns exposed skin, Lyle Chumley (Dwight Yoakam), the town barber, tries to convince them that it is one of the ten plagues before an impending apocalypse. He grows torn when Rebecca tries to explain the rain scientifically. Jeff Daniels stars as Atlantis Cable News anchor Will McAvoy, who takes a mandatory leave of absence after a public tirade about America's shortcomings during a political debate. Upon his return, he discovers that most of his staff have quit. Seeing an opportunity to return to the glory days of televised news instead of ratings-driven infotainment, his boss Charlie Skinner (Sam Waterston) has hired Will's ex-girlfriend MacKenzie McHale (Emily Mortimer) as the new executive producer. McHale shares Skinner's vision of TV news, and she and Will immediately butt heads. The series is executive produced by Aaron Sorkin, Scott Rudin, and Alan Poul. Most episodes feature a storyline taking place in the present (2016–2018, contemporaneous with airing) and a storyline taking place at a set time in the past; but some episodes are set in one time period or use multiple flashback time periods. Flashbacks often focus on Jack and Rebecca c.1980 both before and after their babies' birth, or on the family when the Big Three are children (at least ages 8–10) or adolescents; these scenes usually take place in Pittsburgh, where the Big Three are born and raised. Various other time periods and locations have also served a settings. As adults, Kate lives in Los Angeles, Randall and his family are in New Jersey, and Kevin relocates from Los Angeles to New York City. The episode was directed by Kevin S. Bright, written by Brian Boyle (from a story by Zachary Rosenblatt) and guest-stars Elle Macpherson in her final appearance as recurring character Janine Lecroix. The episode and producers attracted criticism for the blatant product placement present in the story. The tenth and final season of the American television sitcom \"Roseanne\" follows the Conners, a working-class family, struggling to get by on a limited household income in their home at 714 Delaware Street in the drab fictional mid-state exurb of Lanford, Illinois. The season was produced by Carsey-Werner Television, with Roseanne Barr, Bruce Helford, Whitney Cummings, Sara Gilbert, Tom Werner, and Tony Hernandez serving as executive producers. Gordon Ramsay returned as head chef, Scott Leibfried and Andi van Willigan returned as sous chefs and James Lukanik returned as the maître d'. Although the episode was fictionally set in Seattle, filming occurred in Los Angeles, California. Loretta Devine (Adele Webber) reprised her role as a guest star, in addition to Rachel Boston (Rachel Meyer) and Jessica Stroup (Jillian Miller). The title of the episode refers to the song, \"Great Expectations\", by American hard rock band Kiss. The episode received mixed to favorable reviews, with the storyline involving O'Malley's grieving being particularly highlighted. Running for 47 minutes and seven seconds, the episode was viewed by 21.50 million Americans in the United States upon its original airing, ranked first its time-slot and garnered a 7.6 Nielsen rating in the 18–49 demographic. However, the identity of the new narrator (who was also the narrator for Season 14) was never revealed. This is also the first time since Season 9 that a season was 16 episodes, and first time since Season 10 to featured 18 contestants, instead of 20 contestants from the past two seasons. \n",

Entering the matchup, the Warriors were also noted by various sports media outlets as one of the biggest NBA Finals favorites in recent history, drawing some comparisons to the 2001 Finals, where the Los Angeles Lakers, led by Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, were heavily favored over the Philadelphia 76ers, led by Allen Iverson. The Lakers would go on to win the Finals four games to one. This was the first time since 2012 that the Finals did not feature either of the top seeds in each conference. The 2018 Finals began on May 31 and ended on June 8. The series broke the record set by the 2014 NBA Finals for highest average scoring differential per game (15.0) for an NBA Finals series. The Celtics earned their berth into the playoffs by winning the Atlantic Division. The Lakers won the Pacific Division to earn their berth. The Celtics reached the NBA Finals by defeating the Miami Heat in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference First Round, the Cleveland Cavaliers in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference Semifinals, and defending Eastern conference champion Orlando Magic in the best-of-seven . The Lakers reached the NBA Finals by defeating the Oklahoma City Thunder in the best-of-seven Western Conference First Round, the Utah Jazz in the best-of-seven Western Conference Semifinals, and the Phoenix Suns in the best-of-seven . The NBA Finals were scheduled in the Major League Baseball World Series 2–3–2 seven game format, with the Lakers possessing home-court advantage as a reward for finishing with better regular season record than the Celtics. For the 2nd time in 3 seasons and the first time since 2008, all Western Conference playoff teams had at least 50 wins. The 7 games separating 1–8 was tied for the smallest margin, also from 2008. The Boston Celtics lost a best-of-7 series after leading 3–2 for the first time to the Magic in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. Before that, their first round series with the Chicago Bulls set an NBA Playoff record for the most overtime games (4) and periods (7) played. The 2010 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2009-10 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeating the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics 4 games to 3 in the NBA Finals. Kobe Bryant was named NBA Finals MVP for the second straight year. This was the Golden State Warriors' third consecutive trip to the NBA Finals and ninth appearance overall, having come short of back-to-back titles in the 2016 NBA Finals by losing in seven games after having a 3–1 lead. With the acquisition of free agent Kevin Durant in the offseason, the Warriors were hailed as a \"Superteam\" by the media and fans, forming a new All-Star \"Big Four\" of Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. Seth Adham Curry (born August 23, 1990) is an American professional basketball player for the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). A native of Charlotte, North Carolina, Curry played collegiately for one year at Liberty University before transferring to Duke. He is the son of former NBA player Dell Curry and the younger brother of current NBA player Stephen Curry. The 2018–19 Cleveland Cavaliers season was the 49th season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Cavaliers entered the season as runners-up in the 2018 NBA Finals, in which they were swept by the Golden State Warriors in four games, the first Finals sweep since 2007, in which the Cavs were also swept, by the San Antonio Spurs. Going into the series, the Heat were heavy favorites with their newly acquired superstars LeBron James and Chris Bosh along with returning superstar Dwyane Wade. The 2010 NBA Finals was the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s championship series for the 2009–10 season. The best-of-seven playoff was contested between the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers (who were also defending NBA champions), and the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics. The Lakers defeated the Celtics, four games to three, to win the franchise's 16th NBA championship. The 64th edition of the championship series was played between June 3 and June 17, was broadcast on ABC, and was watched by an average of 18.1 million people. \n",

            "passage:  The Miami Marlins' 2018 season was the 26th season for the Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise in the National League and the 7th as the \"Miami\" Marlins. Don Mattingly was the manager of the Marlins for a third year. The Marlins played their home games at Marlins Park as members of the National League East Division. They failed to make the playoffs for the 15th consecutive season. The 2019 American League Wild Card Game was a play-in game during Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2019 Postseason contested between the American League's two wild card teams, the Oakland Athletics and Tampa Bay Rays. It was played on October 2, with Tampa Bay advancing to the American League Division Series to face the Houston Astros. The game was televised nationally by ESPN, and was sponsored by Hankook Tire for the second straight year. An alternate telecast, featuring Statcast analytics and sponsored by Amazon Web Services, aired on ESPN2. The game set the record for the highest attendance at a wild card game with an attendance of 54,005. The 2019 National League Wild Card Game was a play-in game during Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2019 postseason contested between the National League's two wild card teams, the Washington Nationals and Milwaukee Brewers. Played on October 1, Washington won by a score of 4–3 to advance to the National League Division Series to face the Los Angeles Dodgers. The game was televised nationally by TBS. The Miami Marlins' 2019 season was the 27th season for the Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise in the National League and the 8th as the \"Miami\" Marlins. The Marlins played their home games at Marlins Park as members of the National League East Division. They were unable to improve upon their record from the previous season, finished with the second worst record in the history of the franchise at 57-105, and were eliminated from the postseason for the sixteenth straight year. One highlight of their season was winning a season series over the Philadelphia Phillies for the first time since 2008, and sweeping them away from Florida for the first time since 2009. They only won two other season series, against the Padres and Diamondbacks. The 2017 Miami Marlins season was the 25th season for the Major League Baseball (MLB) Marlins franchise, all in the National League, and the sixth as the \"Miami\" Marlins. The Marlins played their home games at Marlins Park and hosted the 2017 MLB All-Star Game. The Marlins were managed by Don Mattingly in his second season as manager of the team. They finished the season 77–85 to finish in second place, 20 games behind the Washington Nationals, in the National League East Division. They failed to make the playoffs for the 14th consecutive season. The Miami Marlins are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in Miami, Florida. They play in the National League East division. Since the franchise was established in 1993 as the Florida Marlins, the Marlins have selected 32 players in the first round. Officially known as the \"First-Year Player Draft\", the Rule 4 Draft is MLB's primary mechanism for assigning players from high schools, colleges, and other amateur clubs to its franchises. The draft order is determined based on the previous season's standings, with the team possessing the worst record receiving the first pick. In addition, teams which lost free agents in the previous off-season may be awarded compensatory or supplementary picks. The First-Year Player Draft is unrelated to the 1992 expansion draft in which the Marlins filled their roster. The Miami Marlins are a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise based in the U.S. state of Florida. The Marlins became members of MLB as an expansion team in the 1993 season. Through 2017, they have played 3,981 games, winning 1,870 and losing 2,111 for a winning percentage of .470. This list documents the superlative records and accomplishments of team members during their tenures as Marlins in MLB's National League East. The Marlins have the distinction of winning a World Series championship in both seasons they qualified for the postseason, doing so in 1997 and 2003—both times as the National League wild card team. They defeated the American League (AL) champion Cleveland Indians in the 1997 World Series, which was notable for shortstop Édgar Rentería driving in second baseman Craig Counsell for the series-clinching run in the 11th inning of the seventh and deciding game. The 2003 season was notable for the firing of manager Jeff Torborg after 38 games. The Marlins were in last place in the NL East with a 16–22 record at the time. Torborg's successor, 72-year-old Jack McKeon, led them to the NL wild card berth in the postseason; they defeated the New York Yankees four games to two in the 2003 World Series. This year marked the first season under the new ownership group led by Derek Jeter and Bruce Sherman. The Miami Marlins' 2020 season is the 28th season for the Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise in the National League and the 9th as the \"Miami\" Marlins. The Marlins play their home games at Marlins Park as members of the National League East Division. \n",

It is held on the temporary 6.2km Guia Circuit on the streets of Macau, the Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China as part of the Macau Grand Prix weekend. Before 2005 when the World Touring Car Championship began, the Guia race had been run annually as a one-off international touring car race. The 2024 Summer Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques d'été de 2024), officially known as the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad, and commonly known as Paris 2024, is a forthcoming international multi-sport event that is scheduled to take place from 26 July to 11 August 2024 in Paris, France. The Macau Grand Prix (; ) is a motorsport road race for automobile held annually in Macau.  Since its first running in 1972, the race has been won by international touring car greats such as Tom Walkinshaw, Johnny Cecotto, Roberto Ravaglia, Emanuele Pirro and Andy Priaulx. The Macau International Marathon (; ) is an annual road running event over the marathon distance (42.195 km) which is held the special administrative region of Macau adjacent to the People's Republic of China. The event is sponsored by Galaxy Entertainment Group, a casino and hotel investment company. Spaniard Fernando Alonso won the first Formula One edition of the Grand Prix, driving for the Renault team amid controversial circumstances, when it emerged a year later that his teammate Nelson Piquet Jr. had been ordered to crash on purpose by senior team management to bring out the safety car at a time chosen to benefit Alonso. The race will remain on the F1 calendar until at least 2021, after race organizers signed a contract extension with Formula One Management on the first day of the 2017 event. The previous contract extension was signed in 2012 and lasted until 2017. Since 2008, every race edition has featured at least one safety car, a total of 21 safety car deployments, as of 2019. The Grand Prix was won by Motopark Academy driver Dan Ticktum from pole position, having won the event's qualification race the previous afternoon. The race was stopped for more than one hour because of a major accident that saw Sophia Flörsch of Van Amersfoort Racing sustain spinal fractures. She catapulted into the catch fence above a barrier beside the circuit and struck a photographer's bunker after a collision with the rear of Carlin's Jehan Daruvala. Another driver, Sho Tsuboi, two photographers and a track marshal sustained injuries. Ticktum held off his teammate Joel Eriksson after the restart to win and become the third driver in history to win the Macau Grand Prix back-to-back after Edoardo Mortara in 2009 and 2010 and Felix Rosenqvist in 2014 and 2015. Eriksson finished second and third was another Carlin driver, Sacha Fenestraz. At the previous round in the Race of China, Robert Huff had established himself as the solo championship leader. Norbert Michelisz was leading the Yokohama Independents' Trophy. The 2012 Guia Race of Macau was the twelfth and final round of the 2012 World Touring Car Championship season and the eighth running of the Guia Race of Macau. It was held on 18 November 2012 at the Guia Circuit in the Chinese special administrative region of Macau. The race was part of the Macau Grand Prix weekend, headlined by the Formula Three event. Both races were won by Chevrolet in their final event as a works team; Yvan Muller won the first race and Alain Menu won the second race, while the team's third driver Robert Huff became series champion with second to Menu in the second race. Stefano Comini won the first race, driving a Volkswagen Golf GTI TCR and Tiago Monteiro gained the second one, driving a Honda Civic TCR. \n",

George Russell won the pole position for the qualification race by setting the fastest lap in the event's second qualifying session but lost the lead to Ilott heading into the first corner. The qualification event was neutralised following an accident involving Hongli Ye and Daiki Sasaki, and when the race restarted four laps later, Félix da Costa drafted Ilott and overtook him to take over the lead. Ilott remained close behind Félix da Costa for the remaining five laps but was unable to reduce the time deficit which would have allowed him to affect an overtaking manoeuvre on him who maintained his advantage to win the qualification race.

In October 2007, Arsenal equalled the UEFA Champions League record victory with a 7–0 win over Slavia Prague at the Emirates Stadium. The record was broken the following month when Liverpool defeated Beşiktaş 8–0 at Anfield. All four English clubs competing in the Champions League reached the quarter-finals, resulting in three all-English ties during the competition's latter stages. Liverpool eliminated Arsenal in the quarter-finals, but lost the semi-final to Chelsea, who went on to meet Manchester United in the final in Moscow. United completed the European Double, winning the Premier League two points ahead of Chelsea and winning the UEFA Champions League, again against Chelsea 6–5 on penalties (1–1 after extra time) to lift the European Cup for the third time. This was a unique occurrence – the first time two English clubs had met in the final of the European Cup/Champions League. It was also a repeat of the opening game of the season, the FA Community Shield, which also finished 1–1 and saw a United win on penalties, 3–0. The 2009 FA Community Shield (also known as The FA Community Shield sponsored by McDonald's for sponsorship reasons) was the 87th FA Community Shield, an annual football match contested by the winners of the previous season's Premier League and FA Cup competitions. The match was contested at Wembley Stadium, London, on 9 August 2009, and contested by 2008–09 Premier League champions Manchester United, and Chelsea as the winners of the 2008–09 FA Cup, a repeat of the 2007 match. The game ended in a 2–2 draw – the goals coming from Nani and Wayne Rooney for Manchester United, and from Ricardo Carvalho and Frank Lampard for Chelsea – with Chelsea winning 4–1 on penalties. The competition uses a knock-out format. On July 29, West Ham United played against Tottenham Hotspur, while Hull City meeting Beijing Guoan. Final, 3rd and 4th playoff were played two days later. The 2009 Premier League Asia Trophy  was the fourth edition of the Premier League Asia Trophy, a four-team association football tournament held every two years. Hull City, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United and the local Chinese Super League club Beijing Guoan competed for the title on 29 July and 31 July in the Workers Stadium, Beijing. Tottenham Hotspur won the trophy. Zenit won the match 2–1, Pavel Pogrebnyak scoring just before half-time, before Danny doubled the Russians' lead just before the hour mark. Nemanja Vidić reduced the deficit to one goal in the 73rd minute, but it was not enough to wrest the trophy from Zenit's grasp, as they became the first Russian team to win the competition. The sending-off of Paul Scholes for handball in the 90th minute resulted in him missing Manchester United's opening game in their defence of the Champions League, a home tie against Villarreal. The final was contested as a single match between Iraqi team Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya and Indian team Bengaluru FC. The match was hosted by Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya at the Suheim Bin Hamad Stadium in Doha on 5 November 2016. The 2016 Best Footballer in Asia, given to the best football player in Asia as judged by a panel of 38 sports journalists, was awarded to Shinji Okazaki on Dec 26th, 2016.

            "passage:  Pole position driver Jimmie Johnson maintained his lead on the first lap to begin the race, as Carl Edwards, who started in the second position on the grid, remained behind him. Afterward, Kyle Busch became the leader, and would eventually lead to the race high of 282 laps. On lap 163, early race leader Johnson had collided with Juan Pablo Montoya; when he returned to the track he was seventy-seven laps behind the leader. David Reutimann led after the final pit stops, ahead of Kyle Busch and Jamie McMurray. With seventy-one laps remaining, Kyle Busch passed Reutimann, holding the lead through to the race win. The 2014 Toyota Owners 400 was a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series stock car race held on April 26, 2014, at Richmond International Raceway in Richmond, Virginia. Contested over 400 laps on the D-shaped short track, it was the ninth race of the 2014 Sprint Cup Series championship. Joey Logano recorded his fifth career win in this race. Jeff Gordon finished second, while Kyle Busch, Brad Keselowski, and Matt Kenseth rounded out the top five. The top rookies of the race were Kyle Larson (16th), Justin Allgaier (21st), and Austin Dillon (27th). Joey Logano won the race, his 18th career win in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, having done it from the rear of the field. This race was his 300th Cup Series start. However, on May 4, 2017, due to a rear suspension issue, Logano's win was encumbered. It did not count as a ticket to the Playoffs, which ultimately cost Logano a berth in the post-season, since he did not win again during the regular season nor point his way in. One of the most popular races on the circuit, the Sharpie 500, NASCAR's twenty-fourth race of the season was held on August 26, 2006 under the lights on the 0.533-mile Bristol International Speedway. Kurt Busch won the pole for this event. Matt Kenseth won his second straight Nextel Cup race and, along with points leader Jimmie Johnson, clinched a berth in the Chase for the Nextel Cup. The race, contested over 378 laps, was won by Ryan Newman from Stewart-Haas Racing, after starting fourteenth to polesitter A. J. Allmendinger. Jeff Gordon finished second for Hendrick Motorsports, while his teammate Jimmie Johnson finished the race in third. The race had a total of nine cautions and twenty lead changes among thirteen different drivers. The 2010 Gatorade Duels were two qualifying races for the 2010 Daytona 500 held on February 11, 2010 at the Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. The races determined the field for the race on Sunday, February 14, 2010. Prior to the Duels, only two drivers had their starting positions locked into the 500, they were pole-sitter Mark Martin and Dale Earnhardt, Jr.. Bill Elliott, Joe Nemechek, Scott Speed, and Bobby Labonte were the four fastest non-top 35 drivers, thus locked in. Prior to the race, Kevin Harvick led the Drivers' Championship with 2,920 points, and Hendrick Motorsports driver Jeff Gordon was second with 2,736 points. Behind them in the Drivers' Championship, Denny Hamlin was third with 2,660 points, and Jimmie Johnson was fourth with 2,659 points. Kurt Busch was fifth with 2,658 points. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet was leading with 143 points, twenty points ahead of their rival Toyota. In the battle for third place, Ford had 90 points, six ahead of Dodge. The 500 lap race was the twenty-fourth in the 2009 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Kyle Busch, of the Joe Gibbs Racing team, won the race, with Mark Martin finishing second, and Marcos Ambrose third. There were 11 cautions and 12 lead changes throughout the course of the race. Double Duty also referred to as the Indy-Charlotte Double or Memorial Day Double, refers to an accomplishment in automobile racing in which a driver competes in the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 in the same day. The feat was first attempted by John Andretti on May 29, 1994. In 2001, Tony Stewart became the first and only driver to date to successfully complete all 1,100 miles of both races in the same day.

In one of the most remarkable performances of his career, Jack Nicklaus tied for sixth place at the age of 58. His final round 68 (−4) yielded a 283 (−5), the lowest 72-hole score by a player over age 50 at the Masters. Nicklaus was in contention for the title until well into the back nine holes in the final round. It was his last serious run for a major championship, twelve years after his sixth Masters victory in 1986.

The series featured a total of nine meetings – three fewer than the previous year as the Rieti Meeting, Melbourne Track Classic, Meeting Grand Prix IAAF de Dakar and IAAF World Challenge Beijing all dropped out and the only new addition was the Paavo Nurmi Games. The Rieti Meeting was originally scheduled for 3 September, but the meeting folded due to financial issues. When the seeking deadline passed on 1 September 2011, two candidate cities (London and Doha) had confirmed their candidatures. Barcelona, which investigated a bid, withdrew citing a lack of support from the local population and financial difficulties. Baseball and softball, now governed by a single international federation and thus treated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as two disciplines of a single sport, will be part of the 2020 Summer Olympics program in Tokyo. The sports are not included in Paris' plan for the 2024 Games, but are part of Los Angeles' plan for the 2028 Games. The 2016 IAAF World Challenge was the seventh edition of the annual, global circuit of one-day track and field competitions organized by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). The series featured a total of twelve meetings – one fewer than the previous year as the Ponce Grand Prix de Atletismo and Meeting de Rabat were dropped while the Grande Premio Brasil Caixa de Atletismo returned. The Rieti Meeting was originally scheduled for 11 September, but the meeting folded due to financial issues. A total of seven bids were initially submitted for the 2026 Winter Olympics. Four of the bids were subsequently withdrawn after entering the candidature stage, leaving Milan–Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy and Stockholm–Åre, Sweden as the only two remaining candidate bids. Milan–Cortina d'Ampezzo was elected as the host city at the 134th IOC Session in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 24 June 2019. The 2018 IAAF World Challenge was the ninth edition of the annual, global circuit of one-day track and field competitions organized by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). The series featured a total of nine meetings, with the meetings remaining unchanged from the previous year. The host venue of the Brazilian leg of the series moved from São Bernardo do Campo to Bragança Paulista. \n",

            "passage:  The WDF Asia-Pacific Cup is a darts tournament held biennially since 1976. The tournament consists of a team championship, a pairs championship and a singles championship. All events have a men's competition, and a women's competition. The most recent Asia-Pacific Cup was held in 2010, in Tokyo, Japan. The DHC Cup Girls Bowling International is an annual ten-pin bowling event for professional and amateur female bowlers, held in Japan, and is sanctioned by the Japan Bowling Congress (JBC). Offering an award purse of JPY¥12.0 million (approx. US$128,000), it is currently the third-biggest tournament for females in the world in terms of money, just behind the U.S. Women's Open and the USBC Queens. Astro Arena was selected as the official broadcaster, airing 10 live and 5 delayed telecasts of the matches, while RadioTVSports.com was selected as the official online media partner which covered most of the activities in the tournament(including press conferences), and Best Western Premier Dua Sentral was selected as the Event Hotel. The tournament was supported and sanctioned by the Football Association of Malaysia, Asian Football Confederation, Persatuan Sepak Bola Seluruh Indonesia and Selangor FA. The UNTV Cup is a men's charity basketball league organized in the Philippines. Twelve basketball teams organized by government agencies and guested by celebrities and ex-pro and amateur players compete in the league. The tournament was held between September and October for a period of two to three weeks in either India or South Africa. It had a total prize pool of US$6 million, with the winning team receiving $2.5 million, the highest for a club cricket tournament in history. The format involved the best teams from the premier Twenty20 competitions of eight Test-playing nations, favouring the teams from India, Australia and South Africa. The competition was co-sponsored by NPB Association and Konami from 2005 to 2007 and was therefore known as the Konami Cup. Furthermore, the participation was limited to the East Asian countries (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China). The tournament was stopped between 2009 and 2010 due to the financing issues. It was re-introduced in 2011 and has been hosted by Taiwan and South Korea, unlike the previous, which were held in Japan. The Malaysian ringgit (/ˈrɪŋɡɪt/; plural: ringgit; symbol: RM; currency code: MYR; formerly the Malaysian dollar) is the currency of Malaysia. It is divided into 100 sen (cents). The ringgit is issued by the Bank Negara Malaysia. The ING Cup was hosted by the Hong Kong Football Association and organised by the Asian Football Confederation's (AFC) marketing partner World Sport Group (WSG). The CMC Cup  is a Go competition sponsored by CMC Magnetics of Taiwan and JPMorgan Chase. Unlike other finals that have a best-of-three format, this has only one game. The winner's purse is 2,000,000 TD ($62,700). The Ahan Tongshan Cup is equvilant of the Agon Cup in Japan.

            "passage:  Midseason, the Knicks were dealt with a major blow as both Iman Shumpert and J.R. Smith were traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Starters for the game were selected by the fans, who could select three frontcourt players and two guards for each conference. LeBron James was the leading vote-getter with 1,416,419 votes. Stephen Curry was also voted as a starter in first All-Star selection, after leading all Western Conference guards in the voting, while Kevin Love overtook Dwight Howard for the final frontcourt starting spot for the West. Television rights in the United States belonged to ESPN. It was tipped by many to be one of the deepest and most hyped draft classes in recent years, with several players touted as future stars. State Farm was the presenting sponsor of the draft. College underclassmen that were highly touted by NBA scouts and executives included: Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Aaron Gordon, Julius Randle, Zach LaVine, T. J. Warren, and Gary Harris. Other highly sought after talents included Australian player Dante Exum and Croatian player Dario Šarić, who both declared for the draft, and Doug McDermott, who was automatically eligible as a graduating college senior. However, this draft class appeared to fail to live up to their expectations, with only two players (Embiid and Nikola Jokić) making an All-Star game so far in their careers.  The 1971 NBA World Championship Series was the championship series played at the conclusion of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 25th anniversary season of 1970–71. The Western Conference champion Milwaukee Bucks, who were founded just three years earlier, swept the Eastern Conference champion Baltimore Bullets in four games. Baltimore had dethroned the 1969–70 NBA champion New York Knicks. In the 2013–14 season, The American consisted of 10 members involved in the rearrangement of conferences between the 2013 and 2014 seasons. (Cincinnati, Connecticut, and South Florida) had been full members of the original Big East. One (Temple) had been a football-only Big East member before entering into full membership in The American. The remaining four schools (Houston, Memphis, SMU, and UCF) had previously been members of Conference USA. The Star Lineup is chosen by a vote of the fans online, a vote of media journalists and representatives, and a vote of all of the head coaches of all of the teams in each season of the league. The fans, the media, and the league's head coaches each get 1/3 of the vote distribution. The 2014 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2013–14 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs defeating the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat 4 games to 1 in the NBA Finals. Kawhi Leonard was named NBA Finals MVP. The 2015 UEFA Champions League Final was played at the Olympiastadion in Berlin, Germany, with Spanish side Barcelona defeating Italian side Juventus by 3–1 to win their fifth title and complete their treble. Real Madrid were the title holders, but they were eliminated by Juventus in the semi-finals. The tournament started with a field of 72 teams, organized into four regions of 18 teams, all of which were seeded. The 18 teams in each region consisted of: nine teams selected based on fan popularity per the tournament's website, four teams selected via at-large bids, four teams accepted via buy-in of a $5000 fee, and the returning regional winner from the 2017 tournament. The 2014 NBA draft was held on June 26, 2014, at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. National Basketball Association (NBA) teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players. The draft lottery took place on May 20, 2014. The Cleveland Cavaliers won the draft lottery to earn the first overall pick in the draft; this is the fourth number-one pick for Cleveland since 2003 and third number-one pick over a four-year span from 2011–2014. This draft would also be the first for the reborn Charlotte Hornets, who played as the Bobcats from 2004–2014, since 2001, when the original Charlotte Hornets last selected as the Charlotte Hornets before moving to New Orleans and eventually becoming the current New Orleans Pelicans. \n",

The Bulls–Cavaliers rivalry is a National Basketball Association (NBA) rivalry between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Chicago Bulls. The teams have played each other since the Cavaliers joined the NBA as an expansion team in 1970, but the rivalry didn't begin in earnest until the Bulls drafted Michael Jordan with the third overall pick in 1984. After Jordan would go on to the Washington Wizards and eventually retire, the rivalry died down, but when Cleveland picked LeBron James with the first selection in 2003, the rivalry heated up again. However, the Cavaliers had an edge on the Bulls, who would pick Derrick Rose with the first selection in 2008 to turn Chicago from a lottery team, to a future contender. The 2014 NBA draft was held on June 26, 2014, at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.

The Minnesota Timberwolves are a National Basketball Association (NBA) team based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. They are a member of the Northwest Division of the NBA's Western Conference. In order to persuade the NBA to give Minnesota a team, Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner, the future owners of the organization, conducted a \"name the team\" contest and eventually selected two finalists, the \"Timberwolves\" and the \"Polars\", in December 1986. The team then asked the 842 city councils in Minnesota to select the winner, as the \"Timberwolves\" prevailed. Minnesota was given a team, and took part in the 1989 NBA Expansion Draft with the Orlando Magic. The Timberwolves have since made eight playoff appearances, advancing to the Western Conference finals once during the 2003–04 NBA season, where they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers. Since the franchise's inception, 198 players have made an appearance in a competitive game for the team. In the games, players can choose an existing NBA franchise and play exhibition or regular season games, as well as create their own players to include in regular season team rosters. Charles Barkley, Shaquille O'Neal and Michael Jordan were represented in the game with other names (Forward, Center and Guard respectively). Television rights in the United States belonged to ESPN.

            "passage:  Officially known as the NFL Draft, the event is the NFL's primary mechanism for distributing newly professional players finished with their college football careers to its teams. The draft order is determined based on the previous season's standings; the teams with the worst win–loss records receive the earliest picks. Teams that qualified for the NFL playoffs select after non-qualifiers, and their order depends on how far they advanced. The final two selections in the first round are reserved for the Super Bowl runner-up and champion. Draft picks are tradable, and players or other picks can be acquired with them. The draft lottery took place during the playoffs on May 16, 2017. The 53–29 Boston Celtics, who were also the #1 seed in the Eastern Conference and reached the Eastern Conference Finals at the time of the NBA draft lottery, won the #1 pick with pick swapping rights thanks to a previous trade with the Brooklyn Nets, who had the worst record the previous season. The Los Angeles Lakers, who had risked losing their 2017 first round pick to the Philadelphia 76ers, moved up two spots to get the No. 2 pick, while Philadelphia moved up to receive the No. 3 pick due to the Sacramento Kings moving up in the draft, which activated pick swapping rights the 76ers had from an earlier trade. On June 19, four days before the NBA draft began, the Celtics and 76ers traded their top first round picks to each other, meaning the holders of the top four picks of this year's draft would be exactly the same as the previous year's draft. Television rights in the United States belonged to ESPN. It was tipped by many to be one of the deepest and most hyped draft classes in recent years, with several players touted as future stars. State Farm was the presenting sponsor of the draft. College underclassmen that were highly touted by NBA scouts and executives included: Andrew Wiggins, Jabari Parker, Joel Embiid, Aaron Gordon, Julius Randle, Zach LaVine, T. J. Warren, and Gary Harris. Other highly sought after talents included Australian player Dante Exum and Croatian player Dario Šarić, who both declared for the draft, and Doug McDermott, who was automatically eligible as a graduating college senior. However, this draft class appeared to fail to live up to their expectations, with only two players (Embiid and Nikola Jokić) making an All-Star game so far in their careers.  The 2018 NBA draft was held on June 21, 2018, at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. National Basketball Association (NBA) teams took turns selecting amateur United States college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players. It was televised nationally by ESPN. This draft was the last to use the original weighted lottery system that gave teams near the bottom of the NBA draft better odds at the top three picks of the draft while teams higher up had worse odds in the process; the rule was agreed upon by the NBA on September 28, 2017, but would not be implemented until the 2019 draft. It was also considered the final year where undrafted college underclassmen were forced to begin their professional careers early; on August 8, 2018, the NCAA announced that players who declared for the NBA draft and were not selected would have the opportunity to return to their school for at least another year. With the last year of what was, at the time, the most recent lottery system (with the NBA draft lottery being held in Chicago instead of in New York), the Phoenix Suns won the first overall pick on May 15, 2018, with the Sacramento Kings at the second overall pick and the Atlanta Hawks at third overall pick. The Suns' selection was their first No. 1 overall selection in franchise history. They used the selection on the Bahamian center Deandre Ayton from the nearby University of Arizona. An automatic bid is a bid or berth to a tournament, granted based on performance in prior competition, and not based on subjective picking (see: at-large bid). It is used in the United States in all professional sports, in which all playoff bids are automatic and determined by objective formulae; in college sports, all divisions (except the highest division of college football) use a mix of automatic bids and subjective selections to seed the postseason tournaments. The tournament started with a field of 72 teams, organized into four regions of 18 teams, all of which were seeded. The 18 teams in each region consisted of: nine teams selected based on fan popularity per the tournament's website, four teams selected via at-large bids, four teams accepted via buy-in of a $5000 fee, and the returning regional winner from the 2017 tournament. The National Basketball Association's first overall pick is the player who is selected first among all eligible draftees by a team during the annual National Basketball Association (NBA) draft. The first pick is awarded to the team that wins the NBA draft lottery; in most cases, that team had a losing record in the previous season. The team with the first pick attracts significant media attention, as does the player who is selected with that pick. Each NBA franchise seeks to add new players through an annual draft. The NBA uses a draft lottery to determine the first three picks of the NBA draft; the 14 teams that did not make the playoffs the previous year are eligible to participate. After the first three picks are decided, the rest of the teams pick in reverse order of their win–loss record. To be eligible for the NBA Draft, a player in the United States must be at least 19 years old during the calendar year of the draft and must be at least one year removed from the graduation of his high school class. From 1967 until the ABA–NBA merger in 1976, the American Basketball Association (ABA) held its own draft. The 2014 NBA draft was held on June 26, 2014, at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. National Basketball Association (NBA) teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. college basketball players and other eligible players, including international players. The draft lottery took place on May 20, 2014. The Cleveland Cavaliers won the draft lottery to earn the first overall pick in the draft; this is the fourth number-one pick for Cleveland since 2003 and third number-one pick over a four-year span from 2011–2014. This draft would also be the first for the reborn Charlotte Hornets, who played as the Bobcats from 2004–2014, since 2001, when the original Charlotte Hornets last selected as the Charlotte Hornets before moving to New Orleans and eventually becoming the current New Orleans Pelicans. Under the current rules, only the top four picks are decided by the lottery, and are chosen from the 14 teams that do not make the playoffs. The team with the worst record, or the team that holds the draft rights of the team with the worst record, has the best chance to obtain a higher draft pick. After the top four positions are selected (from the lottery slotting system), the remainder of the first-round draft order is in inverse order of the win-loss record for the remaining teams, or the teams who originally held the lottery rights if they were traded. The lottery does not determine the draft order in the subsequent rounds of the draft. \n",

            "passage:  Second-year driver, 23-year-old Jeff Gordon from nearby Pittsboro, was cheered on by the hometown crowd to a popular win. It was his second career NASCAR Winston Cup win, and thrust the young Gordon into superstardom on the racing circuit. The Pop Secret Microwave Popcorn 400 was a NASCAR Winston Cup event that took place in November at the North Carolina Motor Speedway from 1965 to 2003. It was the first NASCAR Cup Series victory for three drivers including Mark Martin in 1989, Ward Burton in 1995, and Johnny Benson in 2002. It was the final race win for Bill Elliott in 2003. The 61st International 500 Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday, May 29, 1977. Considered one of the most historically significant editions of the Indianapolis 500, several sidebar stories complemented the unprecedented accomplishment of race winner A. J. Foyt. Foyt became the first driver to win the Indianapolis 500 four times. As of 2019, Foyt's record has been tied by Al Unser Sr. and Rick Mears, but still stands as an Indy 500 record. Foyt's victory is also the last time the winning car (both chassis and engine) was built entirely within the United States. During the inaugural race, Charlie Glotzbach led 285 laps out of 295 to win ahead of Charlie Blanton, who was two laps down. Before the race, only 13 cars were able to qualify before rain moved into the area, causing the remainder of the grid lined up according to sign-in time at the track. In 2008, Joey Logano won after taking the pole position and leading 257 laps out of 312. In 2009 Sean Caisse won the spring event, and Parker Kligerman won in the fall. The final race was held in 2010, and was won by Ty Dillon. The race was notable for being the first time in NASCAR's modern era (since 1973) that all track activity prior to the race was cancelled by rain and for the race itself to be delayed to Monday, where it was won by Brad Keselowski's Team Penske Ford. The race was the first Daytona 500 win for Penske Racing and the first run using NASCAR's Car of Tomorrow, which was introduced in 2007 and became standard in 2008. Additionally, this was the first official race under the new Sprint Cup banner as the telecommunications giant replaces Nextel as the series sponsor after their 2005 merger. Ryan Newman's victory with the number 12 car in the Daytona 500 was the first time since Bobby Allison's #12 won the race in 1988, 20 years prior. The race was known as the second leg of the sport's Grand Slam from 1970 to the demise of the Grand Slam as a result of the Ferko lawsuit in 2004. The GEICO 500 was also previously part of the Winston Million. Chase Elliott is the defending winner of the race, having won it in 2019. The race began with Kyle Busch, from Joe Gibbs Racing, on the pole. During the race there were seven different leaders, fourteen lead changes, and eight cautions. Then, Denny Hamlin, also from Joe Gibbs Racing, won the 2010 Gillette Fusion ProGlide 500. Joe Nemechek would defeat Ricky Rudd by just one car length (.081 of a second) in front of 90,000 fans. Nemechek won the pole position for the race at just over during Friday's qualifying session. The race took three hours to complete and nine caution periods slowed the race for 39 laps. The race began at approximately 2:00 PM EDT and concluded at approximately 5:07 PM EDT. At an interview done in 2012, Nemechek praised NASCAR's then-lenient rules on \"vehicle innovation\" that allowed him to acquire his fourth (and final) NASCAR Cup Series victory. The 2010 Brickyard 400, the 17th running of the event, was a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series stock car race held on July 25, 2010 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indianapolis, Indiana. Contested over 160 laps, it was the twentieth race of the 2010 Sprint Cup Series season. The race was won by Jamie McMurray, for the Earnhardt Ganassi Racing team. Kevin Harvick finished second, and Greg Biffle, who started seventh, clinched third. \n",
